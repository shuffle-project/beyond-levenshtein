I will now turn the call over to Colin Jones, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategy. Sir, you may proceed. Thank you, operator. Welcome everyone to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by our President and CEO, Mary Berner, and our CFO, Frank Lopez Balboa. Before we start, please note that certain statements in today's press release and discussed on this call may constitute forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current assessments and assumptions, and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the supplementary information is useful to investors, although it should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A full description of these risks as well as financial reconciliations to non-GAAP terms are in our press release and SEC filings. The press release can be found in the investor relations portion of our website and our Form 10-Q which was also filed with the SEC shortly before this call. A recording of today's call will be available for about a month and details for how to access that replay can also be found on our website. With that, I'll now turn it over to our President and CEO, Mary Berner. Mary? Thanks, Colin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis, maximizing revenue, offsetting the virus's impact through rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement, and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well-positioned for long-term success. To those ends, we grew revenue sequentially each month in the quarter, with September finishing 35% higher than June. We executed on our expense reduction plan, realizing over $25 million of fixed cost savings in the quarter, with the expectation of delivering more than $85 million in 2020. We generated positive EBITDA and cash from operations for the quarter, bringing year-to-date free cash flow, excluding M&A and the ABL draw, to over $45 million. We strengthened our balance sheet significantly, completing the initial closing of our tower sale lease agreement of the caseback transaction, finishing the quarter with over $350 million of cash, a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional debt paydown. While the environment remains uncertain, we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet. On virtually all metrics, our third quarter results represented a significant and improvement from Q2. Same station revenue finished down 29% year over year, but as I mentioned, improved sequentially each month in terms of total dollars. In the spot market, which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business, we saw year over year improvement each month, both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars. Like last quarter, our diary markets, which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns, outperformed our people. PPM markets. Political, as you might expect, was clearly very strong as our footprint overlapped nicely with swings dates. We had 5.8 million of political revenue in the quarter, which was a new high watermark for a third quarter, and had benefited from that spending pace through the election. Government spending also contributed positively in the quarter, and while still negative versus last year, financial, general services, and professional services also outperformed other categories. Digital as a whole posted another quarter of growth. While streaming and local digital marketing services remained pressured in the difficult macro climate, podcasting more than offset those declines. Up nearly 50% in the quarter, podcasting delivered record quarterly revenue, reflecting our particularly strong News Talk portfolio and our highest ever download count, over 102 million in September, up 47% year over year. Also in the quarter, we launched the new Marketplace Minute, a short form, three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money, business, economy. Developed in partnership with American Public Media, the Marketplace Minute is distributed across smart speakers, broadcasting, and podcasting. Marking the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach, the Marketplace Minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcast audiences. On the expense front, we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately $85 million of fixed cost reductions for the year, including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of $36 million. More than $25 million of these fixed cost savings were achieved in Q3, and we anticipate realizing more than $15 million in Q4. Many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic-induced revenue However, others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future, informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs. For example, we've consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing, research, and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration at work. that was previously in place. Lastly, we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes, particularly in non-revenue producing functions. With the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management, we delivered positive free cash flow for the second straight quarter during the pandemic. We further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our Tower Sale leaseback transactions, which brought our quarterly quarter-end balance to more than $350 million. These significant cash reserves not only provide us security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead, but also the capability and flexibility to act on accretive opportunities that may come our way. Looking ahead as we move into the fourth quarter, we continue to see positive momentum in bookings, driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams. Current pacing is down in the mid-teens versus last year, with political providing about a 450 basis point benefit. We remain guarded about the finish to the year given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country, potential shutdown measures and reaction to that, and the generally uncertain macro environment. So, for the remainder of the fourth quarter, and likely well into 2021, while we hope for continued improvement, our performance will remain high highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events. However, it goes without saying that we remain unrelentingly disciplined and focused on continuing to re-engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our costs. That said, given our liquidity position, more efficient expense profile, and growth initiatives, we feel comfortable about our ability to not only stay the course, but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when it occurs. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank? Thank you, Perry. I will start by providing some more detail on the third quarter, speaking on a same-station basis, and follow that with some additional color on non-operating items. In Q3, total revenue was $196.4 million, down 29.4% from Q3 2019, an increase of 34.5% over Q2 total revenue. As Mary noted, on a monthly basis, we saw total revenue improvement as the quarter progressed, with September revenue 35% higher than June. Spot and network markets performed comparably in the quarter, down in the low 30s versus 2019, with digital slightly offsetting those results up 2%, driven by our podcasting business, which was up nearly 50% on an entirely organic basis. Digital dollars represented over 10% of revenue in the quarter. Political spend accelerated as the quarter went on, finishing at $5.8 million versus $1.7 million in Q3 2019 and $3.6 million in Q3 2018. Of note, this was a record quarter for political and we're on track for another record quarter in Q4. Moving down to P&L, expenses declined by $42 million or 19% driven by both reductions in variable costs related to the revenue declines and active fixed cost reductions. As Meredith mentioned, we continue to expect to realize more than $85 million in benefits in total this year from our fixed cost actions to date. Of these, more than $25 million were achieved in Q3, and more than $15 million will be achieved in Q4. Broken down between temporary and permanent effects, about $19 million of the $85 million relate to permanent actions which have an annualized expense benefit of approximately $36 million. The amount of the temporary costs that will return over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in 2021. Putting revenues and expenses together for the quarter, EBITDA finished at $20.4 million. Normalizing for M&A activity, we once again grew our cash balance by $3.5 million in the quarter, bringing total free cash flow generation year-to-date including M&A and the ABL draw to more than $45 million. Achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is a result of positive EBITDA generation, rigorous management of working capital, and reduced CapEx. As we said on our last call, we cut our 2020 CapEx spend projection to $17 million, and with $4 million spent in Q3, we are on track to deliver that. Our cash taxes this year have also been materially reduced from the combination of lower operating performance and CARES Act benefits. So in Q3, we received approximately $2.5 million of tax refunds related to taxes paid in 2019. I would also note that in Q4, working capital requirements coming from increased revenues are just seven per bond interest payment, and those small and estimated tax payment related to the gain on the tariff sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generated. year-to-date. We were pleased to announce about a month ago the initial closing of the Tower transaction, which provided a cash inflow of $202.3 million. Under our debt agreements, $64 million of the net proceeds from the assets being sold and not leased back are required to pay down debt pro rata, subject to a 12-month reinvestment price. $96 million of the proceeds from assets being sold and leased back were required to pay down debt immediately. As such, concurrent with the closing, we paid down $49 million of the term loan at par, and on Monday, October 5th, we launched a tender offer for $47.2 million of senior secured bonds at par. The tender offer was successfully completed on November 3rd. We do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds from the power transaction by the end of the first half of 2021. Additionally, for tax purposes, the gain on the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year. Net debt now has been reduced by more than $330 million since the beginning of the year, and by more than $585 million, or 46%, since the quarter that we emerged from bankruptcy. As a reminder, we do not have financial maintenance covenants in either our term loan or bonds, and they do not mature until 2026. As mentioned on previous calls, we're also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable precinct property in Nashville, and we hope to bring to market once commercial real estate activity approaches more typical levels. Lastly, I wanted to note some new disclosure in our 10Q related to the NCAA. Based on the cancellation of March Madness in 2020, we believe the rights fees of 2020 season are not payable to NCAA. The NCAA, however, chose to terminate the contract based on nonpayment of those fees. On September 28, 2020, we and the NCAA file competing lawsuits with regard to the disputes surrounding the agreement. While it is always important for contract disputes to escalate to litigation, and litigation can be unpredictable, we believe in the merits of our position. At this stage, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the outcome of the litigation, but we will keep you informed as it progresses. With that, we can now open the line for Q&A. Operator. Thank you. To ask a question, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone keypad. That is star 1. To withdraw your question, press the pound or the hash key. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from Michael Kapitsky, Noble Capital Market. Thank you for taking the question. First of all, I was wondering, you had mentioned that you have obviously now a large cash position, and you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pare down debt. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then also if there are M&A opportunities, what you may be looking at. Sure. Hi, Mike. You know, I think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us in a fantastic position to be defensive about the uncertainty that exists, but as you point out, also opportunistic in ways that we can use cash to drive value. So obviously, playing down debt remains a huge priority, and we know there's a great return to use our cash that way. However, you know, should interesting opportunities come our way, we're open to considering that, whether in radio or otherwise. But we do recognize the high bar for expected returns. And I was just wondering, as you were kind of giving us some thoughts about Q4 and the pacings there. Can you just kind of give us a little bit of a color on maybe spot versus network, what you're seeing in digital? Just kind of give us a little bit more color on the individual line items in Q4. Hi, Michael. It's Frank. First, let me comment about Q3, then I'll give you a little bit more color on Q4. So Q3 had a very nice recovery in both the spot in the network markets. And as you heard in my prepared remarks, they perform comparably. But I will say that in the third quarter, the national spot improved considerably from the second quarter as we get into a more normalized environment. In the fourth quarter, both channels are progressing nicely. We're benefiting in the network from the return of the NFL, which we're pleased with. The national markets are stronger. If you look at the local markets, so part of the benefits we're getting in the local markets clearly are political, which displaces to some extent some of the local business. So the trends at this point we're seeing is fairly strong, but as Mary talked about in the script, we're cautious with regard to the pandemic and the spread in Maine, CBC and how that will impact the rest of the quarter. And how does the bookings look as you go into December, which is outside of the political realm of, you know, what you may have gotten in October and November? At this point, we'll go with this comment on pacing as of this date. And you'll have more color, obviously, in our earnings call next year. Okay, fair enough. That's all I have. Thank you. you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad. That is star one. To withdraw your question, press the pound or the hash key. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. There are no questions at this time. Okay. Thanks everybody for joining our call today. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

As a reminder, we do not have financial maintenance convenance in either our term loan or bonds, and they do not mature until 2026. As mentioned on previous calls, we're also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable piece of property in Nashville that we hope to bring to market once commercial real estate activity approaches more typical levels. Lastly, I wanted to note some new disclosure in our 10-Q related to NCAA. Based on the cancellation of March Madness in 2020, we believe the rights fees 2020 season are not payable to NCAA. The NCAA, however, chose to terminate the contract based on nonpayment of those fees. On September 28th, 2020, we and the NCAA filed competing lawsuits with regard to the dispute surrounding the agreement. While it is always important for contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable, we believe in the merits of our position. At this stage, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the <inaudible> litigation, but we will keep you informed as it progresses. With that, we can now open the line for Q&A. Operator. Thank you. To ask a question, you will need to press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. That is Star 1. To withdraw your question, press the Pound or the Hash key. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from Michael <unk>, Novo Capital Market. Thank you for taking the questions. Um, first of all, I am… I, I was wondering… You had mentioned that you have, obviously, now a large cash position. It was… And you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pare down debt, so I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then, also, if there are M&A opportunities, what you may be looking at. Sure. Hi, Mike. Um, you know, I, I, I think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us, uh, in a fantastic s- position to be defensive about the uncertainty that exists but, as you point out also, opportunistic in ways that we can use, uh, cash to drive value. So, obviously, playing down debt remains a huge priority, and, uh, we know there is a great return to use our cash that way. However, you know, uh, uh, should interesting opportunities come our way, we're open to considering that, uh, whether in radio or otherwise. Uh, but we do recognize the high bar for expected return. And I was just wondering as you were kinda giving us some, um, thoughts about, uh, Q4 and, and the, and the pacings there. Can you just kinda give us a little bit about, uh, color on maybe, uh, spot versus network, um, what you're seeing in digital? Um, just kind of give us a little bit more color on the, um, on the individual line items, uh, in Q4. Um, hi, Michael. It's, uh, Frank. Uh, first, let me, uh, comment about Q3, then I'll give you a little bit more color on Q4. So Q3 had a, a very nice recovery in both the spot and the network markets. And, as you heard in my prepared remarks, they performed comparably. Uh, but I will say that, in the third quarter, uh, the national spot improved considerably from the second quarter as we got into a more, uh, normalized environment. Um, in the fourth quarter, um, both channels are progressing nicely. We're benefiting, uh, in the network, uh, from the return of the NFL, uh, which we're pleased with. Um, the… Uh, the national markets are, are stronger. Uh, if you look at the local markets, though, um, part of the benefits we're getting, uh, in the local markets, clearly political which displaces, to some extent, uh, some of the local business. Uh, so the trends, um, at this point, uh, we're seeing is fairly strong, but it's very <inaudible> and we're cautious, uh, with regard to the, the pandemic and, and the spread and, uh, it remains to be seen how that will impact the rest of the quarter. And how did the bookings look as you go into December, which is outside of the political realm of, you know, what you may have gotten for, in, in, um, in October and November? At this point, we'll really just comment on pacing, um, as of this date. Um, and you'll have more color, obviously, in our earnings call, uh, next year. Okay. Fair enough. That's all I have. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. That is Star 1. To withdraw your question, press the Pound or the Hash key. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And there are no questions at this time. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. Thanks. <inaudible>.

This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available later today. happy to take your questions. A reminder that these statements made during this call that might include one gas expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered under the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements and include, among others, statements about the length and severity of a pandemic or other health crisis, such as the outbreak of COVID-19. For discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Joining us on the call this morning are Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer, Karen Lawhorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Curtis Dynan, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and Sid McAnally, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And now I'll turn the call over to Karen. Thanks, Brandon. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced that we updated our 2020 financial guidance with net income and earnings per diluted share expected to be near the upper end of the ranges, which are $186 to $198 million for net income and $3.44 to $3.68 for earnings per share. Our guidance for capital expenditures and asset removal costs remained $500 to $525 million for the year. Turning to our actual results, net income for the third quarter was $21.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $17.5 million, 33 cents per diluted share in the same period 2019. Our third quarter results reflect an increase in net margin of $5.2 million over the same period last year, which is primarily due to $3.7 million from new rates and $2.7 million in residential sales from net residential customer growth. Operating costs for the third quarter were $0.8 million higher compared to the same period last year. This includes an increase of $1.8 million in expenses related to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $1.5 million increase in employee-related costs. Offsetting a portion of those cost increases is a reduction in expenses of dollars for travel and employee training costs that have been impacted by the pandemic. We have not recorded any regulatory assets for financial accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting orders received in all jurisdictions that allow us to defer, for regulatory purposes, certain net increases in expenses and lost revenue due to COVID-19. We continue to evaluate whether amounts expected to be recoverable under these accounting orders are both measurable and probable of recovery, and we'll record such amounts for financial accounting purposes when we meet that hurdle. Our guidance for 2020 does not assume that we will record any regulatory assets by the end of the year. Our capital expenditures and asset removal costs decreased this quarter compared with the third quarter last year simply due to timing. Yesterday, the OneGas Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.54 per share. for share and the payment of dividends in the system in August of 2020. Authorized rate base, reflecting our recent regulatory activity, is approximately $3.71 billion as of September 30. Authorized rate base is defined as the rate base reflected in completed regulatory proceedings, including full rate cases and interim rate filings. We project that for 2020, our estimated average rate base, which is defined as authorized rate base additional investments in our system and other changes in the components of our rate base that are not yet reflected in approved regulatory filings will be approximately $3.91 billion, with 42% of that in Oklahoma, 29% in Kansas, and 29% in Texas. We ended the quarter with adequate liquidity, which includes approximately $391 million of capacity in our commercial paper program and all of the capacity under our $250 million 364-day credit facility. Additionally, as of today, of the 30th, 2020, we've issued approximately $13 million of equity under the $250 million at-the-market equity program we put in place earlier this year. We have no plans to issue equity for the remainder of 2020. Now, I'll turn it over to Curtis for our regulatory and commercial update. liability surcharge, or GSRS, that seeks an increase in rates of approximately $7.5 million for capital expenditures incurred during the period covering July 2019 through June 2020. An order from the KCC is expected in December 2020, with new rates going into effect in January. Texas Gas Service filed a rate case in December 2019 for all customers in Central Texas and Gulf Coast service areas, seeking a rate increase and requesting to consolidate the two service areas. In August, the Railroad Commission approved all terms of a $10.3 million settlement, as well as consolidation of the Central Texas service area and the Gulf Coast service area into a new Central Gulf service area. This is a continuation of our strategy to consolidate jurisdictions, With this latest consolidation, we now have five jurisdictions in Texas, down from 10 at the time of spin-off in 2014. Moving on to our commercial activities. During our second quarter analyst call, I discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large transaction companies. that had temporarily curtailed operations at the start of the pandemic, and that we were not seeing any other significant disruptions with our transport customers. For the third quarter 2020, our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in 2019. And on a year to date comparison between years, our transport revenues have erased the second quarter 2020 impact and are now flat year over year. We continue to see strong interest in natural gas from builders and developers. Capital spending to extend our service to reach new customers is the primary driver behind our increased capital expenditures guidance for 2020 as we described last quarter. Despite the pandemic, we're seeing positive economic signs across our footprint, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. As an example, in the Austin area, There have been over 100 new business relocations or expansions announced thus far in 2020, which are expected to provide over 14,000 additional new jobs. This increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base. Year to date, we have averaged approximately 24,000 more sales customers than the same period last year. This increase includes the connection We are also looking at the impact of the moratorium on disconnects for nonpayment by our customers. has also impacted our average customer campus. And now I'll turn it over to Sid for an update on operations. As Karen mentioned, while our capital spend was lower this quarter than the third quarter of last year, the issue is timing rather than performance. We've been pleased with the cadence of capital execution year to date, with more consistent capital spend quarter to quarter than last year, due to favorable weather and improved planning by our asset management, engineering, and field operations teams. We remain on track to meet our capital expenditure guidance as discussed earlier. And now I'll turn it over to Pierce. three things stand out. Our resiliency, adaptability, and commitment to safety. Our performance this year demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses. This year we were able to grow our customer base, improve system integrity, and establish a remote workforce amidst great adversity. Despite the challenges, challenges brought on by the pandemic, our industry is accustomed to frontline response. Across our organization, we quickly implemented additional safety protocols and new processes designed to keep our employees and our customers safe during the pandemic. Thanks to the adaptability and diligence of each employee, we've continued providing service to our customers with minimal disruptions. Finally, in closing, I'd like to recognize One Gas employees and give each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress, resolve when there's no clear end in sight, employees in the face of uncertainty. We'll get through this pandemic by relying on the values that we anchor our company to as we address the challenges that face our business. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Operator, we're now ready for questions. All right. If you would like to ask a question, you may signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star 1 to ask a question. And we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal. All right. And the first question is from Richard Cicirelli with Bank of America. factoring the lingering impact, especially with the resurgence of cases, as you begin to look at your 2021 outlook and the moving pieces, and maybe just also comment on the equity needs into next year as well. Richard, it said, let me start and throw to Curtis for the commercial part of that question, and then Karen can come in on the end in terms of the financing question. We have been preparing for winter since March. We understood that there was a high probability that we would see a second wave and that we would see some commingling of COVID and the flu. So our medical protocols were built with that in mind. We have not seen constraints in our service territories, and our employees have done a remarkable job of proactively participating in our medical program to make sure that we could provide them with the best medical advice to keep them and their families safe. families and our customers safe, but also to allow us to tamp down any widespread unavailability of employees in any of our service territories. So we feel like we're well prepared. We don't say that spiking the ball on the 50. We recognize that there is a challenging time ahead of us, but we think we're as well prepared as we can be. So let me toss to Curtis to respond to the commercial question. you know, we have a very high percent of our customer base being residential. And then about 12 percent, that's our transport customers. So one of the things that I noted in my comment is that we're really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers. So we seem to have returned to a normal level of operations and have actually closed the gap with the activity we saw in the third quarter, closing the gap from what we saw during the second quarter of this year. On the residential side of things, I think we are well prepared in our customer call centers to handle the call volume that we typically run into this time of the year. One of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were at the end of May for Oklahoma and Kansas and a little bit later in Texas is that while those moratoriums were in place, SID's operations teams were able to divert those resources to handle a lot of our other normal annual activities and to get ahead of those activities such that when the moratoriums were lifted, we were able to focus more of our resources on the disconnect process, which helped with our collections through that period. So several factors that we had to remain agile to handle during the year, but cooperation and the work between our commercial and operations teams helped us work The last piece I would say is, as Karen talked about, we do have the regulatory accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions. We'll continue to monitor the activities for increased expenses as well as areas where we've been able to decrease expenses and continue to accumulate those until we're able to go through the regulatory accounting orders. process to begin recovery of those. I'll pick up on the financing question. We have not updated our longer-term guidance for financing, which currently is that we anticipate $850 to $900 million of net financing for, with about a quarter of that being equity. When we issue our guidance for 2021, which we expect to do probably sometime after the first of the year, we'll provide a closer look on what 2021 looks like. Okay, got it. That's a great question. That's very helpful. Appreciate all the color there. And maybe just switching gears here, obviously, with elections on top of mind, just curious how you're thinking about decarbonization goals and just given really some of the potential for electrification and buildings and some of the supply and cost constraints on the R&D side. I mean, is that really the solution or is green hydrogen potentially a more likely candidate? Just maybe curious if you can provide some thoughts us overall on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies. table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that captured gas by bringing it into our system and getting it tracked through to be used as replacement for diesel or other products through compressed natural gas. And so we're continuing to explore and hopefully we'll be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next year. We've proven the commercial availability of those projects and we've established the gas standards and everything that we would need to do to bring that product into our system. So again, we continue to make progress on that. We're also in an H2 at scale project with the University of Texas and other parties including the DOE to run some different scale projects of converting or producing hydrogen both from renewable power as well as from landfill gas. And then using that hydrogen that's produced to run a computer center at the University of Texas, as well as provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So we're continuing to... That project just started earlier in the mid part, actually, of 2020. So it's about a three-year project, but promising results come out of that. Then I'm going to turn it to Sid, and he can talk a little bit more about what we're doing and what we're seeing on the operating side. side to analyze the impact of hydrogen? including the engineering implications. There will be policies and procedures around hydrogen use. And there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen at the proper blending rate and handle that safely in terms of continuing to focus on safety of our system. The second is a really interesting working group that's looking at the gas supply implications. Hydrogen is a different material to compounds. press and transport, and so the location of manufacturing facilities comes into play. We're scoping all of that right now and excited about continuing the conversation. All right. Thanks very much for all the color there. That's all I have. All right. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. If you find your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two. The next question is from, and I apologize if I say this incorrectly, Aga Migordza with UBS. Good morning. Good morning, Aga. Could you give us an update on bed debt and how is it trending this year as we head into winter? Sure. Good morning, Aga. This is Karen. So we're still, as Curtis described, some of our collections activity, that's still at play. So we're not out of the COVID impact, certainly by a long stretch. We currently are $8.8 million of bad debt expense through the nine months. That compares to $4.6 million last year. So we're up about $4 million year over year. And again, we just work to monitor the situation. There are still some issues. And so until we get completely back to normal collections activities for an extended period of time, it's going to be difficult to really determine what the impact has been. And how has the change in Kansas related to eliminating state income taxes from rates could impact YDAS's cash flow going forward? It's not expected to have a material impact in the scheme of things. It's not a large enough impact. overall tax picture, the elimination of the state income tax is not a large event. Last question for me to follow up on Richard's question on decarbonization. Is there a regulatory framework in place to invest in RNG across your jurisdictions? Do you have tariffs established to potentially cover some additional costs related to investments in RNG and ecology? is actually contemplated in the tariffs in Texas. It is a recoverable gas cost there. So that has previously been contemplated as part of the gas supply picture. In Oklahoma, there was legislation introduced in the last session to compel the commission to study RNG and to look at ways to bring RNG into the Oklahoma gas supply. With the pandemic starting, that was not a bill that was considered all the way through session. But outside of that, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has opened up a notice of inquiry, looking at several different energy questions, one of which is renewable natural gas and the way that the state and the commission should deal with that product. So there are efforts underway at the state levels also. Not as much at this point in Kansas, but the other two states are a little bit further along in that regard. Thank you for the caller and stay safe. Thank you, Megan. Alright, and once again that is star one to ask a question. And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Losey, I'd like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you all again for your interest in OneGas. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until we release earnings in February. We'll provide details on the conference call at a later date. Have a great day. disconnect.","groundTruth":"Good day and welcome to the ONE Gas Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

First, I'll provide an overview of recent regulatory activity and then provide an update on our commercial activities. Kansas Gas Service filed a Gas System Reliability Surcharge, or GSRS, that seeks an increase in rate approximately $7.5 million for capital expenditures incurred during the period covering July 2019 through June 2020.

During our second quarter analyst call, I discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large transport customers that temporarily curtailed operations at the start of the pandemic, and that we were not seeing any other significant disruptions with our transport customers. For the third quarter 2020, our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in 2019.

This increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base. Year-to-date, we have averaged approximately 24,000 more sales customers than the same period last year. This increase includes the connection of 18,600 new customers compared with 14,600 new customers in the same period last year, or a 27% increase over last year's pace. As I described during our last two quarterly analyst calls, the impact of the <unk> on disconnects for non-payment by our customers, which expired in May in Oklahoma and Kansas and early October in some areas of Texas, has also impacted our average customer counts. And now, I'll turn it over to Sid for an update on operations. Thanks, Curtis. Our team in the field continues to adapt well to the current environment, with maintenance and compliance work on or ahead of schedule. Our supply chain remains uninterrupted and we see no forward constraints to our planned work, thanks to steady performance by our resource management team related to materials and contractor resources. As Caron mentioned, while our capital spend was lower this quarter than the third quarter of last year, the issue is timing rather than performance. We've been pleased with the cadence of capital execution year-to-date with more consistent capital spend quarter-to-quarter than last year. Due to favorable weather and improved planning by our asset management, engineering and field operations teams, we remain on track to meet our capital expenditure guidance, as discussed earlier. And now, I'll turn it over to Pierce. Thank you, Caron, Curtis and- and Sid. The pandemic has changed many things for many people. Our homes have become the place where we spend more and more time. Our customers take comfort in the warmth of our- that our product provides, especially as we head into colder weather. As we near the end of the year, it's natural to reflect on how we- how far we've come. For me, three things standout: our resiliency, adaptability and commitment to safety. Our performance this year demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses.

And we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal. All right. And the first question is from Richard Ciciarelli with Bank of America. Hey. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? We can. Good morning, Richard. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Um, I was just curious how you guy are- are thinking about, um, COVID in- into peak winter heating season here. And I realize OGS has the higher proportion of residential versus C&I transport customers. But how are you, uh, thinking about factoring the lingering impact, especially with the resurgence of cases, as you begin to look at your 2021 outlook and the moving pieces? And maybe just also comment on, uh, the equity needs, uh, into next year as well. Richard, it's Sid. Let me start and throw to Curtis for the commercial part of that question, and then Caron can come in on the end in terms of the financing question. We have been preparing for winter, uh, since March. We understood that there was a high probability that we would see a second wave, and that we would see some co-mingling of COVID and the flu, so our medical protocols were built with that in mind. Uh, we have not seen constraints in our service territories, and our employees have done a remarkable job of proactively participating in our medical program to make sure that we could provide them with the best medical advice to keep them and their families, and our customers safe, but also to allow us to tamp down any widespread, uh, unavailability of employees in any of our service territories, so we feel like we're well prepared.

So, Richard, on the commercial side of things, as you know, we have a very high percent of our- of our customer base being residential. Um, and then about 12% that's our transport customers. So, one of the things that, uh, I noted in my comments is that we're really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers, so we've seemed to have returned to a normal level of operations and have actually closed the gap with the activity we saw in the third quarter, closing the gap from, uh, what we saw during the second quarter of this year.

One of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were, uh, the end of May for Oklahoma and Kansas, and a little bit later in Texas is that, while those moratoriums were in place, Sid's operations teams were able to divert those resources to handle a lot of our other normal annual activities. And to get some of those things- get ahead of those activities, such that when the moratoriums were lifted we were able to focus more of our resources on the disconnect process, which helped with our collections through that period. So, um, several, uh, factors that we had to- to remain agile to handle during the year, but, uh, cooperation and the work between our commercial operations teams helped us work through that part of it to be ready when we could again resume disconnects, and that's helped our overall process. The last piece I would say is, um, as Caron talked about, we do have the regulatory accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions. Uh, we'll continue to monitor the activities for increased expenses, as well as areas where we've been able to decrease expenses, um, so that- and continue to accumulate those until we're able to, uh, go through the regulatory process to begin recovery of those. So, I'll pick up on the financing question. We have not updated our longer term guidance for financing, which currently is that we anticipate $850 million to $900 million of net funds <inaudible> or with about a quarter of that being equity. Uh, when we issue our guidance for 2021, which we expected to do probably sometime after the first of the year, we'll provide a closer look on what 2021 looks like. Okay. Got it. That's, uh, that's very helpful. Appreciate all the color there. And maybe just, uh, switching gears here, obviously, with, uh, elections on top of mind. Just curious how, uh, you're- you're thinking about decarbonization goals. And just given really some of the, um, potential for electrification in buildings, and some of the supply and cost constraints on the RNG side. I mean, is that really the solution, or- or is green hydrogen potentially a more likely candidate? Just- just maybe curious if you can provide some thoughts, uh, overall on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies. Another good question, Richard. Um, this is Curtis again. So on the commercial side, I've talked before about efforts we've had around renewable natural gas. Um, there are several different projects and developers that we're talking to. Um, some already captured RNG and use it for alternative uses. What we may be able to bring to the table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that captured gas. So, by bringing it into our system and getting it tracked through to be used as replacement for diesel or other products through compressed natural gas. And so, we're continuing to explore, and hopefully we'll be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next ye- <inaudible>. We've proven, uh, um, the commercial ability of those projects, and we've established the gas standards and everything that we would need to do to bring that product into our system. So, again, we continue to make progress on that. We're also, uh, in an H2@Scale project with the University of Texas and some other parties, including the DOE to run some different scale projects, um, converting or producing hydrogen, both from renewable power, as well as from landfill gas. And then using that- that hydrogen that's produced to run a computer center at the University of Texas, as well as provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So, we're continuing to… That project just started earlier in the mid-part, actually, of 2020. So it's about a three-year project, but <inaudible> promising results come out of that. I'm going to turn it to Sid, and he can talk a little bit more about what we're doing and what we're seeing on the operations side analyzing the impact of hydrogen <inaudible>. Yeah, Richard, thank you for the question. Um, as you know, there is a commercial component to this, an RND component, as you point out. But there are also some practical implications, uh, that companies need to consider as- as emergent opportunities, like hydrogen start to be developed. We have two working groups in place currently. One is looking at technical issues, including the engineering implications. There will be policies and procedures around hydroden- hydrogen use. And there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen at the proper blending rate and handle that safely in terms of continuing to focus on safety of our system. The second is an- a really interesting working group that's looking at the gas supply implications. A hydrogen is a different material to compress and transport, and so the location of manufacturing facilities comes into play. We're scoping all of that right now and excited about continuing the conversation. All right. Thanks very much for- for all the color there. Uh, that's all I had. All right. Once again, that is * 1 to ask a question. If you find your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing * 2. The next question is from… And I apologize if I say this incorrectly, Aga- uh, <unk> with UBS. Good morning. Morning, Aga. C- could you give us an update on bad debt and how is it trending this year as we head into winter? Sure. Good morning, Aga. This is Caron. So, we're still, uh, as Curtis described, some of our collections activity, uh, that's still- that's still at place, so we're not out of the COVID impact, certainly by a long stretch. We currently, um, are $8.8 million at bad debt expense through the nine months. That compares to $4.6 million last year, so we're up about $4 million year-over-year. And again, we just work to monitor the situation. We- uh, there are still mora- moratoriums in place in some of the service areas. And so, until we get completely back to normal collections activities for an extended period of time, it's going to be difficult to really determine what the impact has been. And, uh, how the change in Kansas related to eliminating state income taxes from rates could impact ONE Gas' cash flow going forward? It isn't expected to have a material impact. In the scheme of things, it's not a- not a large in our overall tax picture, the elimination of the state income tax is not a large event. <inaudible> The last question from me, to follow-up on Richard's question on decarbonization. Is there a regulatory framework in place to invest in RNG across your jurisdictions? We have tariffs established to potentially cover some additional costs related to investments in RNG. Any color would be helpful. Sure, Aga, this is Curtis. RNG is actually contemplated in the tariffs in Texas. It is a recoverable gas cost there. Um, so that- that was- that has previously been contemplated as- as part of the gas supply picture. In Oklahoma, there was legislation introduced in the last session to compel the Commission to study RNG and to look at ways to bring RNG into the Oklahoma gas supply. With the pandemic starting, that was not a bill that was considered all the way through Session. But outside of that, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has opened up a notice of inquiry, looking at several different energy questions, one of which is renewable natural gas, and this- and the way that the state and the Commission should deal with that product. So, there are efforts, um, under way at the- at the state levels, also. Not as much at this point in Kansas, um, but the other two states are a little bit further along in that regard. Thank you for the color, and stay safe. Thank you, Aga. All right, and once again, that is * 1 to ask a question. And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Lohse, I'd like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you all again for your interest in ONE Gas. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until we release earnings in February. We'll provide details on the conference call later date. Have a great day. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Michael Frenz. Sir, the floor is yours. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the third quarter 2020 Clipper Realty, Inc. earnings conference call. Participating with me on today's call are David Bistrasser, co-chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and JJ Bistrasser, chief operating officer. Please be aware that statements made during the call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q posted today, the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2020, and the company's 2019 annual report on Form 10-K, accessible at www.sec.gov and our website. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, November 9th, 2020, and the company undertakes no duty to update them.

Please see our press release, supplemental financial information, and Form 10-Q posted today for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I will now turn the call over to our co-chairman and CEO, David Bistracer. Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter of 2020 earnings call for the crypto realty. I will provide an update on our business performance, including recent highlights and I will turn the call over to JJ. We have been grateful for the efforts of the tenants. Our properties have remained open and operational throughout the pandemic. We continue to take necessary steps to keep our tenants safe in compliance with state and local orders and providing typical services to our residents. At quarter end, our residential properties was 93% leased compared to 96% at the end of the second quarter. Despite the current headwinds, we are confident in the resiliency of New York City and we expect our properties in the New York City market to remain desirable to a broad range of tenants and our operations to return to a normal rate state over time. Our balance sheet continues to be well positioned from a liquidity perspective to manage through the pandemic. We have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million of unrestricted cash and $22 million of restricted cash. We finance our portfolio on an asset by asset basis and our debt is in non-recourse and is non-cross collateralized. We have no debt maturities on any of our operating properties until 2027. During the third quarter, we purchased 45,858 shares of Commerce stock at a weighted average price of $5.90 a share under our $10 million stock repurchase We have $9.7 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. Turning to upcoming developments, we continue to proceed with the redevelopment of our Pacific street acquisition located in Brooklyn, about one mile from the center hub. and develop at a 6.5% stabilized cap rate. JJ will provide further updates on the project shortly. In our office portfolio, the new lease with the city of New York at 250 Livingston Street commenced in August. This lease is expected to initially add substantially approximately $5.1 million to the property's annual NOL and is a significant milestone for the company. At 141 Livingston Street, the city's rent will increase $2.1 million to the property's annual NOI. Together, these roles are expected to add an incremental $7.1 million of annual NOI to our portfolio, representing an approximate 10% increase on our normalized run rate. At our property, we are continuing with the uniform land use review procedure, or ULIP approved process with the city. We anticipate that approval will add significant value to the annual NOI. significant floor area ratio for the complex, meaningful expanding the size of the property, adding significant value and allowing us to begin development. There is no insurance, however, that the application will fully or partially approved or submitted. I'd like to provide an update to the Tribeca House 421G Cubsish litigation. As previously disclosed, the New York City Court of Appeals rules in June 2019 that apartments and buildings receiving 421G tax benefits are not subject to luxury the court of appeals ruling Regina case only that the base rent for the termination of rent overcharges is four years prior to the 2016 filing of the Cummins complaint and overcharges if any are to be determined by comparing the rents actually charged during the four-year period to the rent increases permitted by New York City Rent Leveling Guidelines Board. Although not a lawful measure, the court of appeals ruling, the court of appeals ruling, The case will be remanded back to the lower court which will determine the amount of liability for rent overcharges and attorney's fees. No future court dates have been scheduled as of yet. We do not believe that this litigation will have a material impact on our business as it pertains to the limited sum of money that we have. We are reporting quarterly revenues of $29.6 million. Shortly, I will now turn the call over to JJ, who will provide an update on operations and our response to the pandemic, including a targeted overhead reduction to future streamlined expenses. Thank you. I begin by asking, and again thanking our colleagues at our properties and corporate office for their tireless efforts throughout this challenging period. Their unwavering commitment to our tenants and communities has been inspiring. We faced certain revenue challenges in the third quarter as a result of declines in economic activity related to COVID-19. Third quarter total revenue was 3.6% lower than second quarter total revenue driven by declines in occupancy and rental rates at several of our properties due to the ongoing pandemic. Rent per square foot at Chebeke was $66 at the end of the third quarter. We are working diligently to manage revenue at the property and note that occupancy has recently increased 83%. Longer term, we believe that occupancy and rental rates at the property will return to pre-COVID levels given Trebekah House's attractiveness from a pricing standpoint compared to other luxury buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. The Flappage Gardens complex in Brooklyn held up well in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint, as it has throughout the pandemic. The property maintained high occupancy ending the quarter over 96% lease. Rent per square foot was a record $25.10 at the end of of the quarter. We continue to proactively streamline the business and manage our expense base and have reorganized certain operations at the property, which is expected to result in annual cost savings in excess of $800,000. Flapper's Gardens is a key element of our portfolio and growth story, with the FAR expansion project an incremental value opportunity. The Clover House Aspen and 10 West 65th Street properties experienced some occupancy and pricing pressures due to COVID-19, each ending the third quarter approximately 90% leased compared to middle 90 levels at the end of the second quarter. We have, however, seen a recent uptick in activity at these properties with occupancy gains ranging from 380 to 610 basis points since the end of the quarter. Collections have remained strong during the pandemic. Our rent collection rate in the third quarter was 97%. We continue to work with tenants on a case-by-case basis when they notify us that they cannot meet their rent obligations as a result of the pandemic, including reviewing potential alternative payment arrangements. On the development side, we are completing the necessary regulatory process at 1010 Pacific Street to construct a nine-story, 119,000 rentable square foot, fully amenitized, multifamily rental building with underground indoor parking. The property will have 175,000 total units, 70% of which will be free market and 30% affordable, and is eligible for a 35-year 421A tax abatement. We are in the process of negotiating a construction loan for the project. Looking ahead, we are focused on optimizing occupancy, pricing, and expenses across the business against the backdrop of ongoing pandemic-driven headwinds that continue to pressure both our portfolio and the New York City market in general. The near-term environment will remain challenging, but we are committed to strongly positioning ourselves to emerge from the pandemic. I will now turn over the call to Michael, who will discuss our financial results. Just one moment, gentlemen. Michael's line has disconnected. We're reconnecting him now. Hello? Hello? We're trying to connect Michael Friends. His line has dropped. That's me. I'm back. Oh, you're back. Okay, perfect. Thanks. Michael, you're on. I am. Thanks, guys. Apologies for that. Had a connection problem. Okay, for the third quarter, we achieved revenues of $29.6 million, an increase of 0.2 million, or 0.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. We achieved NOI of $14.5 million and AFFO of $2.9 million, or $0.06 per share. The year-over-year total revenue increase was primarily attributable to the commencement of the new office lease at the 250 Livingston Street property and bringing the Glover House property online during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by a decline in lease occupancy and residential rental rate for Tribeca House property. On the expense side, key year-over-year changes as follows. Property operating expenses increased by $0.5 million in the third quarter year on year, primarily driven by an increase in the provision for bad debt due to the impact of COVID-19. Real estate taxes and insurance increased by $0.7 million in the third quarter due to property tax increases across their portfolio and general insurance industry cost increases. Interest excents increased by $1.5 million in the third quarter year on year, primarily due to the recognition of interest expense in connection with bringing Cloverhouse online and the refinancing of the Flatbush Gardens property in May. As David mentioned earlier, we are well positioned from a liquidity perspective. As of September 30th, we have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million of unrestricted cash and 22 million of restricted cash. We finance our portfolio on an asset by asset basis. Our debt is non-recourse and is not cross collateralized. maturities on any operating properties until 2027. Lastly, today we are announcing a dividend of nine and a half cents per share for the third quarter, the same amount as last quarter. The dividend will be paid on November 27th to shareholders of record on November 20th. Let me now turn the call back over to David for concluding remarks. Thank you, Michael. We remain focused on efficiently operating our portfolio throughout the pandemic with the safety of our tenants and employees are highest priority. We continue to take the necessary steps to navigate through the current challenges, whether it's by strong balance sheets. New York City has survived and thrived through challenging circumstances over time, and we have every confidence that the city will emerge from the pandemic as strong as it has. We look forward to capitalizing on a myriad of growth opportunities, including the 10-10 Pacific Street redevelopment and the potential expansion of Flappage Gardens. We hope everyone stays safe and healthy. With that, I would like to open up the line for questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is open for questions. If you have any questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one on your touchtone phone. Pressing star two will remove you from the queue should your question be answered. And lastly, while posing your question, please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we poll for questions. And your first question is coming from Craig Kucera. Craig, your line's live. Yeah, hi, I just wanted to confirm guys did you say that? outside of Tribeca where you gave the update that that occupancy had improved at 83% You mentioned flatbush that all the other properties had seen anywhere from a 380 to 610 basis point in occupancy since the third quarter Yes, yeah, hi Craig, how are you? When at the end of the second quarter some of the properties as we said has been 10 West at Clover they were all in the mid 90s percent occupancy range, 95 to 97%. By the end of the third quarter, they had dipped a bit to 90%, but since the end of the third quarter, between then in September and today, we see a bump back up on those properties anywhere from three to four to 5%. So the Athens, NW and Cloverhouse properties currently are leased ranging from 92 to 95%. Okay, great. And I just wanted to follow up up on rents. Have rents trended flat in the fourth quarter, or have there been any rent concessions to get those folks back? start pushing rents again. For now, we're doing the best we can and making sure that we don't lose any opportunities to rent apartments. There's a slight downtick in the rent per square foot because of that. point in the future but are no longer in the greater New York MSA? return to the city. Okay, well that's encouraging. That's it for me. Thanks guys. If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star 1. Okay, your next question is coming from Buck Horn. Buck, your line's live. Yeah, hey, thanks. Hey Mike, could you just what the bad debt expense was in the quarter. I don't know if you broke, did you break that up in the operating expenses? Absolutely. As a refresher in the second quarter, as you know, we took about a $600,000 bad debt expense and now into the third quarter here, again, given the high collection rate, as JJ said, we're still in the high 90s. So what we've seen is actually to date, pretty good and strong performance, even as the pandemic lingers. All in all, at the third quarter, We took a proximate $660,000 charge for bad debt, so about a 10% increase over the second quarter. But again, given everything that's been going on with the pandemic, I think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see collections hold up overall. Okay, if there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one. Okay, we have no remaining questions in queue. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Stay safe. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation. Thank you.","groundTruth":"Welcome to the Compumedics audio conferencing system.

I will provide an update on our business performance including recent highlights and milestones as well as how our company is responding to COVID-19 pandemic. I will then turn the call over to J.J. who will discuss property level activities, including leasing performance and measures taken in line of the pandemic. Finally, Michael will speak about our quarterly financial performance. We will then take your questions. I will begin by thanking the entire Clipper team for the continued hard work and perseverance during this challenging period. The ongoing dedication to our residents, our communities, and our business has been remarkable throughout the course of the pande- the pandemic and we are grateful for their efforts. Our properties have remained open and operational throughout the pandemic. We continue to take necessary steps to keep our tenants safe in compliance with state and local orders and providing typical services to our residents. During the third quarter, we witnessed some pressure on occupancy and rental rates at several of our properties driven by economic activity declines related to COVID-19. At quarter end, the residential properties was 93% leased compared to 96% at the end of the second quarter. Despite the current headwinds we are confident in the resiliency of New York city and we expect that properties in the New York city market to remain desirable to a broad range of tenants and our operations to return to a normal rate state over time. Our balance sheet continues to be, to be well positioned from a liquidity perspective to manage through it, through the pandemic. We have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million unrestricted cash and $22 million of restricted cash. We finance our portfolio on asset by asset basis and debt in recourse, in non-recourse and in non-cross-collateralized. We have no debt maturity on any of our operating properties until 2027. During the third quarter, we purchased 45,858 shares of common stock, at a weighted average price of $5.90 cents a share on the $10 million stock repurchase program announced in August. At the end of the quarter we had $9.7 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. Turning to upcoming developments, we continue to proceed with the redevelopment of our 10, 10 Pacific street acquisition located in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, about one mile from the, one mile from the Atlantic Terminal Barclays Ha- Center Hall. As previously disclosed, we estimated the project will cost approximately $85 million in total and take two years to complete and develop a 6.5% stabilized cap rate. J.J. will provide further update on the project shortly. In our off- office portfolio, the new lease <inaudible> with the city of New York, 250 Livingstone street commenced in August, this lease is expected to initially add substantially approximately five point million dollars to the property's annual NOL and is significant as a significant milestone for the company. At 141 Livingston street, the city's rent will increase 25% at the end of December, which will add $2.1 million to the property's annual NOI. Together these roles are expected to add an incremental $7.1 million of annual NOI to our portfolio representing approximately 10% increase on a normalized run rate. At our Flatbush Gardens property we are continuing with the uniform land use review procedure or ULURP-approved process with the city, we anticipate that approval will add significant floor area ratio for the complex, meaningfully expanding the size of the property, adding significant value and allowing us to begin development. There is no assurance however that the application will fully or partially approve once submitted. I'd like to provide an update to the Tribeca House 421-g Kuzmich litigation. As previously discussed the New York City Court of Appeals ruled in June, 2019, that the apartments the buildings receiving 421 G tax benefits are not subject to luxury deregulation. October 29th, the appellate divisi- division applied, app-app-applied the court of appeals ruling the Gina case only that the base rent of determination rent over charges is four years prior to the 2016 filing of the Kuzmich complaint and overcharges, if any, are to be determined by comparing the rents actually charged during the four-year period to the rent increases committed by New York City rent- rent guidelines board. Although none of eliminating overcharged liability altogether, this ruling is expected to limit our financial exposure in this regard. The appellate division however, from the law courts award of attorney's fees to the plaintiff's tenants. The case will likely be remanded back to the lower court, which would determine the amounts of liability for rent overcharge and attorney's fees, no future court dates have been scheduled as of yet. We do not believe that this litigation will have a material impact on our business, as it, as it pertains to the limited subsets of previous and existing tenants at the property. The vast majority of current tenants and all future movements are not impacted by litigation as those units are free market. Lastly, I would like to comment on a third quarter results, results. We are reporting quarterly revenues of $29.6 million, NOI of $14.5 million in AFFO of $2.9 million, results that reflect the current headwinds discussed earlier. Michael will provide further details on our financial performance shortly. I will now turn the call over to JJ who provided an update and operations and our response to the pandemic, including a target overhead reduction to future streamline expenses. Thank you. I begin by asking, by again thanking our colleagues at our properties and corporate office for their tireless efforts throughout this challenging period. Their unwavering commitment to our attendance to communities has been inspiring. We faced certain revenue challenges in the third quarter as a result of declines and economic activity related to COVID-19. Third quarter total revenue was 3.6% lower than second quarter total revenue driven by declines in occupancy and rental rates at several of our properties due to the ongoing pandemic. Rent per square foot at Tribeca was $66 at the end of the third quarter, we are working diligently to manage revenue at the property and note that occupancy has recently increased 83%. Long, longer term we believe that occupancy and rental rates at the property we'll return to pre COVID levels given Tribecca houses attractiveness from a pricing standpoint, compared to other luxury buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. The Flatbush Gardens Complex and Brooklyn held up well in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint. As it is throughout the pandemic, the property maintain high occupancy ending the quarter over 96% leased. Rent per square foot was a record $25 and 10 cents at the end of the quarter. We continue to proactively streamlined the business and manage our expense base and have recog, reorganized certain operations at the property, which is expected to result in annual cost savings in excess of $800,000. Flatbush Gardens is a key element of our portfolio and growth story with the FAR expansion project and incremental value opportunity. The Clover House Aspen in 10 West 65th street properties experienced some <inaudible> and pricing pressures due to COVID-19, each ending the third quarter approximately 90% least compared to middle 90 levels at the end of the second quarter. We have however seen a recent uptick in activity at these properties with occupancy gains ranging from 380 to 610 basis points since the end of the quarter. Collections have remained strong during the pandemic, our rent collection rate is in the third quarter was 97%. We continue to work with tenants on a case-by-case basis when they notify us that they cannot meet their rent obligations as a result of the pandemic, including reviewing potential alternative payment arrangements. On the development side, we are completing the necessary regulatory process at 1010 Pacific street to construct a nine storey, 119,000 rentable square foot, fully amenitized, multi-family rental building with underground indoor parking. The property will have 175 total units, 70% of which will be free market and 30% affordable and is eligible for a 35 year 421-a tax abatement. We are in the process of negotiation, negotiating a construction loan for the project. Looking ahead, we are focused on optimizing occupancy, pricing and expense across, expenses across the business against the backdrop of ongoing pandemic driven headwinds that continue to pressure both our portfolio and the New York city market in general. The near term environment will remain challenging but we are committed to strongly positioning ourselves to emerge from the pandemic. I will now turn over the call of Michael who will discuss our financial results. Just one moment, gentlemen, Michael's line has disconnected. We're reconnecting him now. Hello? Yes. This is the operator we're trying to connect Michael Frenz, his line has dropped Yes. That's me. I'm back. Oh, you're back. Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Micheal your on. Oh yeah, thanks guys, apologies for that I had a connection problem. Okay. For the third quarter, we achieved revenues of $29.6 million an increase of 0.2 million or 0.6% compared to the same period in 2019. We achieved NOI of 14.5 million and AFFO of $2.9 million or six cents per share. The year over year total revenue increase was primarily attributable to the commencement of the new office lease at the 250 Livingstone Street property and bringing the global house property online during the third quarter of 2019. Partially offset by decline in leased occupancy and residential rental rate to Tribeca house property. On the expense side, to year over year changes were as follows. Property, property operating expenses increased by 0.5 million in the third quarter year on year, primarily driven by an increase in the provision for bad debt due to the impact of COVID-19. Real estate taxes and insurance increased by $0.7 million in the third quarter due to property tax increases across the portfolio and general insurance industry cost increases. Interest expense increased by 1.5 million in the third quarter year on year, primarily due to the recognition of interest expense in connection with bringing Clover House online and the refinancing of the Flatbush Garden's Property in May. As David mentioned earlier, we are well positioned from a liquidity perspective. As of September 30th, we have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million of unrestricted cash and 22 million of restricted cash. We finance our portfolio on an asset by asset basis. Our debt is non-recourse and its not cross-collateralized. We have no debt maturities on any operating properties until 2027. Lastly, today we are announcing a dividend of nine and a half cents per share for the third quarter, the same amount as last quarter, the dividend will be paid on November 27th to shareholders of record on November 20th. Let me now turn the call back over to David for concluding remarks. Thank you, Michael. We have remained focused on efficiently operating a portfolio throughout the pandemic with the safety about tenants and employees our highest priority. We continue to take the necessary steps, steps to navigate through the current challenges leveraged by strong balance sheet. New York City has survived and thrive through challenging circumstances over time and we have every confidence as a city will emerge from the pandemic as strong as ever. We actively look forward to capitalizing in a myriad of growth opportunities including the 1010 Pacific Street redevelopments, and the potential expansion of Flatbush Gardens. We hope everyone stays safe and healthy with that. I'd like to open up the line for questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, the floor is open for questions. If you have any questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one on your touch tone phone, pressing star two will remove you from the queue should your question be answered. And lastly, while posing your question, please pick up your handset, if listening on speaker phone to provide optimum sound quality, please hold while we pull for questions. And your first question is coming from a Craig Kusera. Craig, your lines live. Yeah. Hi. Um, I just wanted to confirm. Guys, did you say that, um, outside of Tribeca where you gave the update that, that occupancy had improved to 83%, uh, you mentioned Flatbush that, that all the other properties had seen anywhere from 380 to 610 basis point occupancy, uh, since the third quarter? Yes. Yeah, hi Craig, how are you? When, at the end of the second quarter some of the properties, as we said, Aspen, 10 West and Clover house, they were all in the mid nineties percent occupancy range, 95 to 97%. By the end of the third quarter, they had dipped a bit to 90%, but since the end of the third quarter, between end of September and today, we see a bump back up on those properties anywhere from three to four to five percent. So, the Aspen, 10 West and Clover House has properties currently are least ranging from 92 to 95%. Okay, great. And, um, I just wanted to follow up on, um… And h-h-h-have rents trended basically flattened in here in the, in the, in the fourth quarter? Or has, has there been any rent concessions to get those folks back? J.J do you want to talk through that? Sure. Um, so the rents have pretty much stayed, um, a drop below what they were prior simply because we're trying to recapture occupancy so that we're well, well, you know, positioned for when the market does come back to stop pushing rents again. So for now we're doing the best we can and making sure that we don't lose any opportunities to rent apartments. So there's a slight downtick in the rent per square foot because of that. Got it. And, uh, and just one more for me. Um, you know, are you tracking or able to track whether, um, you know, as the folks moved out from second to third quarter, are they, are they staying in market or are these people that are basically just exiting the markets? Uh, maybe they'll come back at some point in the future, but are no longer in the greater New York MSA. Um, to answer that again, without the exact detail numbers, um, the answer is a significant amount of them are moving out of, out of the cities. Some of them depending on the property they are moving to, let's say second homes that they have in the suburbs. Um, many of them tell us when on the way out they say, You know, we wish this didn't come to this, we, we hope to be back soon. We really liked the, the property and we're looking forward to when things get back to normal so we can return to the city. Okay. Well, that's, that's encouraging. Uh, that's it for me. Thanks guys. If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one. Okay, next question is coming from Buck Horne. Buck, you lines live. Yeah. Hey, thanks. Hey Mike, could you just quantify what, what the bad debt expense was in the quarter? I don't know if you ever. Did you break that up? The operating expenses? Absolutely. Uh, as a refresher in the second quarter, as you, as you know, we took about a $600,000 bad debt expense. And now into the third quarter here, again, given the high collections rate, collection rate, as J.J said, we're still in this sort of in the high nineties. Uh, so what we've seen is actually to date pretty good and strong performance, even as the pandemic lingers. Uh, all in all, in the third quarter, we took approximate $660,000 charge for bad debt, so about a 10% increase over the second quarter, but again given everything that's been going on, uh, with the pandemic, I think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see, uh, collections hold up overall. Okay. If there any remaining questions or comments please indicate So now by pressing star one. Okay we have no remaining questions in queue. Thank you for us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Stay safe. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.

Sales income and others decreased to RMB7.3 million from RMB139 million for the third quarter of 2020, mainly due to the decrease in sales related to the Wanlimu e-commerce platform, which we are in the process of winding down. decreased by 55.5% to RMB8 million from RMB18 million for the third quarter of 2020 due to the decrease in the amount of merchandise credit transactions. Our cost of revenues decreased by 47.4% to RMB104.6 million from RMB198.8 million for the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with the loan. book business and a decrease in cost of goods sold related to Wanlimu e-commerce platform.

For the benefit of all participants on todayís call, if you wish to ask your question to the management in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English. Zhang from Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Thank you, management, for taking my questions. This is Franklin from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one is on the 1-A, more kids program. Could you please provide more color on how many more in the pipeline, maybe in the next year? And also, how's the payback period apply currently as well as the unit economics? And the second question is on cost revenue. I noticed that on sequential basis, cost revenue increased. Can you maybe break down a little bit on what's driving the increase? Thank you. Thank you, Frank. Thanks for the questions. So to address your first question with regard to our Wiley Mo Kids business, we actually had three centers in operation during the third quarter and seven centers now. There will be over 10 centers in the pipeline for next year. The performance, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is not as good as we expected because of the on and off regional COVID breakout. You know, when we see positive COVID cases in the city, kids activity centers are the first ones to be shut down and the last ones to be opened. And therefore, our centers have been shut down for almost two month period during the third quarter because of COVID. So, our... And once a center got cooled down because COVID, we need another two or three months to heat it up again. It's really hard to answer the question regarding to payback period and the stabilized UE because we are not in that stage yet. And our current imminent goal is to bring our centers to break-even points as soon as possible do any further expansion. I hope that answers the question. With regard to our cost of revenues, just a moment please. The cost of revenues, because we didn't provide the breakdowns in our earnings as the segment reporting is not required under certain accounting rules, but the majority of the increase of cost of revenues is because of, you know, when we do the one-day more kids business, we have to hire teachers and instructors in our centers. So their costs are in the cost of revenue. Hope that answers the question. Thank you very much. Thank you. Once again, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you. As there are no further questions, now I would like to turn the call over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you. So thank you everyone once again for joining us today. It's a relatively short call. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact our investor relations team. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes the conference call.

Thank you. are among the best names to participate in data center investments across the globe. As you are aware, SIPI has a very active business present in the data center services. And we have been continuously investing and expanding our data center capacity, considering the highly encouraging demand for data center co-location services. So this investment from KOTAK is through a compulsorily convertible instrument where it is meant for financing or rather part financing some of our greenfield data center capacity expansion over the next three years. So that's the background of the investment and the investment house. Okay, in terms of, I guess, does it accelerate your ability to invest? Does it give you greater flexibility? I'm just trying to understand a little bit better, what advantages taking that outside capital has for you? Yeah, so it actually does multiple things. One is it helps us fast track our data center capacity the next three years. And lastly, participation by an established banker and the sovereign wealth funds who are globally respected LPs also validates our data center business model and our competencies in this business. So it places before us capital for expansion and also gives us access to raise capital beyond what we have already no, that's off the table. that investment to be made? of new greenfield projects for which the projects will be taken up effective from March of this calendar year. of the different pieces, I'm assuming cloud and managed services was continuing to grow, but can you just give me a little breakdown of that 18% decline? Yeah. So as far as the SIFI digital service are concerned, as you rightly observed, the cloud and managed services continues to grow. Whereas in this particular quarter, our technology integration services to be executed. Those projects execution is work in progress. And given the pandemic associated supply chain issues, those projects will get completed, hopefully in this calendar quarter, in this quarter four. So the cloud and managed services grown during the quarter and the other, particularly the telecom sector, will be technology integration services, there's a degrowth. view, I guess, looking forward in terms of maybe some of the constraints on the business in terms of the pandemic. I'm pleased to announce that we have a new model for data center services. We are very pleased to announce that many organizations are still pursuing work from home as a model. From a business perspective, as far as chairman observed in his opening remarks, the network and data center services demand continues to be high and growing.

Our successful delivery for hyperscalers is a strong endorsement of our agility and capability on the data center front and increases the attractiveness of our data centers toward enterprise clients. With the market learning to work around the pandemic, these demands should continue. As with previous quarters, I would like to expand on the business highlights and summarize our business performance. As part of our corporate venture capital initiative, Sify's partner invested during the quarter US dollars 100,000 in the earlier announced startups in the Silicon Valley area. Sify committed to a capital outlay of INR 9900 million towards fresh capacity building for data center expansion in the Navi, Mumbai region. This is in addition to the capital outlay of INR 1200 million for expansion of DC capacity in the same region. Sify Technologies has been recognized as a niche player in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for managed network services. The recognition is for completeness of vision and ability to execute leading to superior quality of service. The business continues to grow the reach of the network. As of 31st December, 2021, Sify provides services via 769 fiber nodes and 1,893 wireless base stations across the country. A 6% and 11% increase respectively over the same quarter last year. As part of this digital experience project, Sify completed full automation of service assurance, asset management and service provisioning across this network. This will accelerate the deployment of a streamlined customer experience in the coming quarters. To summarize our business performance, revenue from data center colocation services grew by 44% with the same quarter last year. Revenue from digital services fell by 18% or same quarter last year. And revenue from network-centric services grew by 8% with the same quarter last year. The revenue split between the businesses during the quarter was data center colocation services at 30%, digital services at 24%, and network centric-services at 46%. A detailed list of our key wins is recorded in our press release. Now live on your, on our website. Let me bring in Vijay, our CFO, to elaborate on the financial highlights for the past quarter. Vijay? Yeah, thank you, Kamal. Good morning, everyone. Let me briefly some of the financial performance for the third quarter of financial year 2021- 2022. Revenue was INR 6783 million, a growth of 8% over the same quarter last year. inaudible was INR 154 million, an increase of 22% over the same quarter last year. Profit before tax for the quarter was INR 477 million, an increase of 19% over the same quarter last year. Profit after tax was INR 344 million, an increase of 36% over the same quarter last year. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR 2887 million. The customer demand for digital infrastructure services continues to be encouraging. We will continue to expand on our data center and network capacity. Uh, fiscal discipline will continue right through our investment journey without impacting customer experience. Cash balance at the end of quarter was INR 2381 million. I will now hand over to our chairman for his closing remarks. Thank you, Vijay. India was already in the midst of the transformation of legacy systems through the adoption of automation. The pandemic only accelerated that process. In this process, some of our services made sure through the adoption of enterprises, several are by insured by the enterprise demand. Some are more had to be completely overhauled. inaudible the current CP bouquet of services is well with the market demand. Thank you for joining us on this call. I will now operator… Now I hand over to the operator for purchase. Operator? Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. If you have any questions or comments, please press * 1 on your phone at this time. We ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset as listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question for today is coming from Greg Burns. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Good morning Greg Burns, uh, with SIDOTI & Company. Um, I just wanted to ask about the first about the Kotak investment. Um, what was the rationale behind, um, taking that investment in the, uh, the contact center business and you know, what benefits do you see from, from their involvement? Thank you. Select? Yeah foreign language. Yeah. Uh, thank you, Greg. Uh, Kotak is the ultimate investment fund, which is managed by one of the most established, uh, bankers in India where, uh, the fund has LPs, which include sovereign wealth funds, uh, which are among the best names who participate in data center investments across the globe. As you are aware, Sify has a very active, uh, business presence in the data center services, and we have been continuously investing and expanding our data center capacity, considering the highly increasing demand for data center colocation services. So this investment from Kotak is, uh, through a compulsorily convertible instrument, where it is meant for financing or rather park financing some of our green field data FinTech capacity expansion over the next three years. So that's the background of the investment and the investment, uh, house. Okay. Um, in, in terms of, um, I guess the, does it acce- accelerate your ability to invest? Has it given you greater flexibility? I'm just trying to understand, um, a little bit better, you know, what, what advantage has taken that, that outside capital has for you? Yeah, so, it actually, uh, does multiple things. One is it helps us, uh, fast track our data center capacity expansion as we tend to raise about, um, 1,000 cores, which in terms of INR million is 10,000 million amount of capital, which will be accessible to us for our expansion needs. Along with the debt financing, which we can raise from the banking system. Approximately with a debt equity ratio of 2: 1, it helps us to create substantial capacity over the next, uh, three years. And lastly, participation by an established banker and the sovereign wealth funds who are globally respected LPS also validate our data center business model and our competences in this business. So it places before, uh, capital for expansion and also gives us access to raise capital beyond what we have already contracted. Okay, great. Um, I guess and then, you, you mentioned also, um, committing to, uh, 9,900 million, uh, incremental investment in data centers. Is that, is that all part of this like… With, um… Yeah. incremental capital you raised from Kotak, or is that, is that separate from that? Is that, is that incremental and new? Or how, how should we read into that? And what's the, the timeframe on kind of when you expect that investment to be made? Uh, the numbers, which are being communicated to the press release are for the exist… Are for the data center projects where there is currently work in progress. Those will be financed by internal accruals and debt from the banking system. What we are raising from Kotak special, Kotak fund is for new greenfield projects, for which, uh, the projects will be taken up effective from March of this calendar year. Okay, okay. Um, and then in terms of, um, I guess, your reclassified, um the way you report your, your segments, with, within digital services, could you just give us an idea of, um, the, the growth of the different pieces? Um, I'm assuming cloud and managed services was continuing to grow. But if you just give me a, a little breakdown of that 18% decline? Yeah. So as far as the Sify digital services are concerned, uh, as you rightly observed, the cloud and managed services continues to grow. Whereas the, in this particular quarter, our technology integration services, where we had a couple of large projects to be executed, those project's execution is work in progress. And given the pandemic associated supply chain issues, those projects will get, uh, completed, hopefully, in this calendar quarter, in this quarter four. So the cloud and managed services grown during the quarter. And the others, particularly the technology integration services, there's a de-growth. Okay. Um, I guess, since you brought it up in terms of the pandemic, a- w- where… I guess what's the status of the, the conditions in India like, are, are you, are you constrained by like, um, mandates or lockdowns anymore? Is, is business getting back, more back to normal there? And, you know, uh, uh, what's your view, I guess, looking forward in terms of maybe some of the constraints on the business in terms of the pandemic? Getting back to normal, normal, except that, uh, with this Omicron there are, uh, lockdown specified in a few states for the weekend. Otherwise, the business continued to work as them almost limping back to normal except that many organizations are still pursuing work from home as a model. From a business perspective, as far as the chairman observed in his opening remarks, the network and data center services demand continues to be high and growing. And on the digital transformation services, the customers are, uh, a having extensive conversations. And these conversations we expect to get converted into tangible, uh, orders and revenue conversion in the foreseeable, uh, future. Okay, great, thank you. Thank you. Once again, if there are any questions or comments, please press * 1 on your phone. There are no questions in queue at this time. Thank you. We appreciate your time on this call. We look forward to interacting with you inaudible. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, ladies… Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Those are two completely different numbers. They're 100 fold different. Can you hold on one second for me, okay? Sure. This is Andrea. I'm a manager on the floor. How can I help you today? Hi. Do you recognize that there's a difference between one dollar and one cent? Definitely. Do you recognize that there's a difference between half a dollar and half a cent? Definitely. Then do you therefore recognize that there's a difference between .002 dollars and .002 cents? No. I'm teaching math here. And I mean, I'm trying to get what you're saying here, but it's just not- And we're talking about cents, right? Right, .002. If we multiply that by the amount of kilobytes usage that you have- 35893. 35893, that comes out to what you paid, 71.79. Cents. You never did the conversion from cents to dollars. I don't know. I'm not a mathematician. .002 cents- Right. Times my 35,893. It's - Is a number, but it's still in cents. We're not quoting .002 dollars. We're quoting .002 cents. Oh, God. Honestly. Well, I mean, it's obviously a difference of opinion - It's not opinion! Okay, well, you know what? I'm gonna post this recording on my blog, and- If that's what you want to do, that's fine.

They unite every quality. And sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as chiaroscurists. By being studious of color they are studious of division, and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing, unseparated light. The colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light. My first and principal reason was that they enforced, beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side. Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds, so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge. It is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of Carpaccio's, one of his series of the Life of St. George. Then he comes to the beak of it. The brown ground beneath is left, for the most part. One touch of black is put for the hollow, two delicate lines of dark grey to find the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible. For believe me, the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock-robin is to be red, and of a grass-plot to be green, and the best skill of art is an instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light, which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch. Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper. And that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all around it, being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly. But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly. They are beyond all other works that I know existing, dependent for their effect on low, subdued tones, their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight, and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of grey paper. It may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice, but, loud or low, the virtue is in both cases always in refinement, never in loudness. must, remember, be one or the other. Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one. The law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly, or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful. And I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground. This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative, that it represents beautiful things, in the clearest way, but not under existing conditions, and that, in fact, you are producing jeweller's work rather than pictures. That a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous. In all early Gothic art, indeed, you will find failure of this kind, especially distortion and rigidity, which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art. The large letter contains, indeed, entirely feeble and ill-drawn figures. That is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand. It is not characteristic of Gothic or any other school. But, observe, you can only do this on one condition, that of striving also to create, in reality, the beauty which you seek in imagination. It will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting, unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life. You must look at him in the face, fight him, conquer him, with what scathe you may, you need not think to keep out of the way of him. The colorist says, first of all, as my delicious parquet was ruby, so this nasty viper shall be black. And then is the question, can I round him off, even though he is black, and make him slimy and yet springy and close down, clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth, all the same? Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study of art, than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter. You know I've just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire. Here's an equally typical Greek school landscape by Wilson, lost holy and golden mist, the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatsoever. Perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist. Apollo and the python. Now here is Raphael. Exactly between the two. Trees still drawn leaf by leaf, wholly formal, but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance. Well then, last, here is Ternus. Greek school of the highest class. And you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is, and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire. Only there are two sorts of cloud and fire. He knows them both. There's one and there's another, the Dudley and the Flint. It is only a pencil outline by Edward Byrne Jones, an illustration of the story of Psyche. It is the introduction of Psyche, after all her troubles, into Heaven. Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely. Exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light, this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal. And you may describe and complete their work quite literally, by taking any verses of Chaucer in his tender mood, and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first, and and then on the order. Thus in Chaucer's dream, in both these high mythical subjects, the surrounding nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful. But now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why Turner drew it at all. It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness, and all its lines are cramped and poor. The crampness and the poverty are all intended. It is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old water mill, itself mossy and rent, scarcely able to get its stones to turn. The scene is absolutely Arcadian, see that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite.","groundTruth":"You will find me continually speaking of four men Titian, Holbein, Turner, and Tintoret in almost the same terms.

She was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father, but which, to be full and true, must include a little annoyance. However, out it came. Papa, I do think Mr. Thornton a very remarkable man, but personally I don't like him at all. And I do, said her father, laughing.

Visiting register offices, seeing all manner of unlikely people, and very few in the least likely, absorbed Margaret's time and thoughts for several days. One afternoon she met Bessie Higgins in the street, and stopped to speak to her. \"'Well, Bessie, how are you?' \"'Better, and not better, if you know what that means.' \"'Not exactly,' replied Margaret, smiling. \"'I'm better at not being torn to pieces by coughing and nights, but I'm weary and tired of Milton, and longing to get away to the land of Boola. And when I think I'm farther and farther off, my heart sinks, and I'm no better. I'm worse. Margaret turned around to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward, but for a minute or two she did not speak. At last, she said in a low voice, Bessie, do you wish to die? Bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two. Then she replied, Not worse than many others, I reckon. But what was it? You know, I'm a stranger here, so perhaps I'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if I'd lived all my life in Milton. I had forgotten what I said for the time,\" continued Margaret quietly. I should have thought of it again when I was less busy. May I go with you now? The sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met Margaret's soft and friendly gaze. You will not be daunted if father's at home, and speaks a bit gruffish at first. But Nicholas was not at home when they entered. Gasped Bessie at last. took a long and feverish draught, and then fell back and shut her eyes. Margaret bent over and said, Bessie, don't be impatient with your life, whatever it is, or may have been. Remember who gave it to you, and made it what it is. Now I'll not have my wench preach to— But surely, said Margaret, facing round, you believe in what I said, that God gave her life, and ordered what kind of life it was to be. I believe what I see, and no more. That's what I believe, young woman. I don't believe all I hear. No, not by a big deal. But who's come at last? And who's welcome, as long as who'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about? It's simple, and not far to fetch, nor hard to work. But the girl only pleaded the more with Margaret. Something hardly on him. He's a good man, he is. I sometimes think I shall be mirked with sorrow, Even in the city of God, if either is not there. The feverish colour came into her cheeks, And the feverish flame into her eye. But you'll be there, father, you shall. Oh, my heart! She put her hand to it, and became ghastly pale. Margaret held her in her arms, And put the weary head to rest upon her bosom. the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away. And Bessie roused herself and said, Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful. She was late for tea at home. Have you met with a servant, dear? No, Mama, that Anne Buckley would never have done. Spose I try, said Mr. Hale. Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty. Now let me try. I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all. What would you do, papa? How would you set about it? Very good, but we must first catch our housemother. The mother of whom you spoke to us, said Margaret. I shall like to see her. She must be an uncommon person, her mother added. Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place. She sounded to be such a careful, economical person that I should like anyone out of the same family. \"'My dear,' said Mr. Hell, alarmed, \"'pray don't go off on that idea. I'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it. Take notice that this is not my kind of haughtiness, papa, if I have any at all, which I don't agree to, though you're always accusing me of it.

She and Dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom, from which Dixon would come out crying and cross, as was her custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy. Once Margaret had gone into the chamber soon after Dixon left it, and found her mother on her knees, and as Margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering. But though she received caresses and fond words back again, in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly, yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her, and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health.

I should have thought of it again when I was less busy. May I go with you now? The sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met Margaret's soft and friendly gaze. Yo'll not be daunted if father's at home, and speaks a bit gruffish at first. But Nicholas was not at home when they entered. gasped Bessy, at last. Bessy took a long and feverish draught, and then fell back and shut her eyes. Margaret bent over and said, Bessy don't be impatient with your life, whatever it is or may have been. Remember who gave it you, and made it what it is Now, I'll not have my wench preached to. But surely, said Margaret, facing round, you believe in what I said, that God gave her life, and ordered what kind of life it was to be? I believe what I see, and no more. That's what I believe, young woman. I don't believe all I hear no not by a big deal. But hoo's come at last, and hoo's welcome, as long as hoo'll keep from preaching on what hoo knows nought about. It's simple, and not far to fetch, nor hard to work. But the girl only pleaded the more with Margaret. Don't think hardly on him he's a good man, he is. I sometimes think I shall be moped wi' sorrow even in the City of God, if father is not there. The feverish colour came into her cheek, and the feverish flame into her eye. But you will be there, father you shall Oh my heart She put her hand to it, and became ghastly pale. Margaret held her in her arms, and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom. Presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away, and Bessy roused herself and said, Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful. She was late for tea at home. Have you met with a servant, dear? No, mamma that Anne Buckley would never have done. Suppose I try, said mister Hale. Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty. Now let me try. I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all. What would you do, papa? How would you set about it? Very good. But we must first catch our house mother. The mother of whom he spoke to us? said Margaret. I shall like to see her. She must be an uncommon person, her mother added. Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us, and be glad of our place. She sounded to be such a careful economical person, that I should like any one out of the same family. My dear, said mister Hale alarmed. Pray don't go off on that idea. I am sure, at any rate, she would not like strangers to know anything about it. Take notice that is not my kind of haughtiness, papa, if I have any at all which I don't agree to, though you're always accusing me of it. I don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things I have gathered from him, I fancy so. They cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her."},{"id":"1998-15444-0000","dataset":"librispeech-pc-test-other","hypothesis":" If called to a case supposed or suspected to be one of poisoning, the medical man has two duties to perform.

This podcast, which is produced in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, features sermons and other talks about the exploration and engagement of Christian faith with the world. Jesus Christ both journeyed with his disciples on the road to the biblical Emmaus and broke bread with them, thus revealing himself as both our fellow traveler and the incarnate word of God. Here's what we've got for today. and like candles before it, we are worshipping that icon and giving to it what is due to God alone. Idolatry is one of the most ancient of sins, giving worship to the creation rather than to the creator. It is condemned in the Holy Scriptures many times, being the most visceral kind of apostasy, a betrayal and abandonment of the one true God, giving devotion instead to something else. If it is true that the Orthodox are idolaters, then that means that we are not even Christians. You cannot worship both God and something else. You have to choose. On the Sunday of October that falls either on the 11th or immediately after, we make commemoration of the 7th Ecumenical Council, which met in the year 787 in the city of Nicaea to answer exactly this acumenical question. accusation of idolatry. I won't give you the full details of the arguments made, but I will summarize. The accusers, who were called iconoclasts, a word that means icon smashers, made the argument that because God is invisible, you cannot depict him except symbolically. So to point to an icon and say, there is a picture of God, and especially then and to venerate it is idolatry. The fathers of the council, that is, the Orthodox, instead declared that because God had become incarnate, that is, because the Son of God became man, he is now visible in Jesus Christ. And because he is visible, then that means we not only may depict him, but we must depict him. Not to depict him is to deny the incarnation. Not to depict his saints is to deny that Christ is in them too. And thus, all veneration given to an icon of Christ or to the saints is actually given to the one depicted and not to the material object itself. When you kiss the hand on an icon of Christ, you are kissing Christ. is a central doctrine for Christians. We must believe in it if we are Christians. We cannot deny that God became man and be Christians. And we cannot deny the place that material physical reality has for us and be Christians. What we do with our bodies and with the material world is directly dependent on what we believe about who Jesus Christ is. Because the one true God took on matter for himself by giving himself a human body, then that means that all creation becomes the vehicle for the divine presence. And it means that especially where we see that divinity manifest, we give honor. We worship God alone, but we honor and venerate those people and things in which he has shown his presence. So this has many practical applications. For materiality is not only about what we call the sacraments. One of our problems as Christians living in the 21st century is that we have tried to push God into one place or another and leave him there. We can visit him, but that is where he remains. For those who do not make and venerate icons, their God basically has no presence in the material world. He may be felt or perceived in some sense but he is not here or there in particular. He may be everywhere, but he is not present in this icon or in this saint. But we as Orthodox Christians are guilty of this too, although not in the same way. We are happy to welcome God into our temples, onto our altars, into our icons, et cetera. But when it comes to other elements of materiality, we expect him not to be present. Instead, we exile him. I could mention a number of ways in which we are exiling God, such as when we do not fast, exiling him from our bodies, or when we do not make our homes sanctified with prayer, exiling him from our families. But I will mention now probably the worst problem that we have in this regard. When we do not generously return to him what is already his own, we exile him from our finances. Money can be an uncomfortable topic, but that is why we need to discuss it. For many, it is a festering wound that we want to put a band-aid on, but not cure. So it's uncomfortable. But let's heal it. Given what we have said about God's presence in all of material reality, in certain people and places, we must also acknowledge that He is present in our possessions. And that includes our most tightly held possession, our money. And this presence is especially strong in those things that belong to the people of God. Why? It is because our very presence as baptized and anointed members of the royal priesthood brings the blessing and presence of God wherever we are. Your possession possessions become holy, because you are the one possessing them. Because you belong to God and bring with you the presence of God, then he is more present in the things you own. The earth is the Lord's in the fullness thereof, but he is especially manifest in us, his church. So it is clear that God is present in our possessions. God is present in our money. So knowing that God is present in what we have and knowing also that our task is to offer up the material world to God to ask for his blessing, then that means that we have to get serious about offering our money. Let's be frank. Although it certainly is the case that there are among us those who are indeed serious about offering up their money to God, most of us aren't. No one will judge you but God. But you can also judge yourself. Are you actually actually serious about offering to God what is His? Is what you're giving a true sacrifice? Or are you giving merely a donation? Are you paying dues? Do you think of what you give to God as somehow contributing toward being eligible for a membership? Consider your income. Consider what you offer back to God. You yourself know whether whether what you are sacrificing is appropriate to being a member of the royal priesthood. God is present in this material world and he is present in us, the royal priesthood, and he is present in what we touch and what we possess and maintain because we bring his presence with us. As Orthodox Christians, we do not believe in a theology in which God is separate from the material world and which therefore suggests that our possessions really are ours to do of what we please. What is in your home is sacred. What you wear on your body is sacred. What is in your checking account is sacred. It is sacred because we have been declared by him to be sacred. And this sacredness is transmitted wherever we go because of our common priesthood. It is for this reason that in the Holy Scriptures, God called upon his chosen people to tithe to give 10% of their income to him. This was the called upon sacrifice that was proper to the royal priesthood of God. This was the appropriate way for them to show that they understood the sacred presence of God in their possessions by offering them back to him for his blessing. I know that some people deny that tithing is appropriate for Christians. But we have to ask why. Do they deny it because they have a true theological argument for it? Do they deny it because they found a place in the New Testament in which the Lord or the apostles set that aside? I would welcome hearing such arguments. Alas, I suspect that those who deny this do so because they simply do not believe deep within their souls that God is present in this material world. So that means that the material things they own are really theirs and not God's. I will not say that it is merely because they are greedy or envious. Only God knows that. It is true that the holy fathers of the church actually did change the teaching on tithing that was received from the old covenant. That should not surprise us as there are many things which were changed in the transition to the new covenant. Here is what St. Irenaeus says in the second century. received liberty, that is Christians, set aside all their possessions for the Lord's purposes. And here is St. John Chrysostom speaking about someone who complained about tithing. What a load of disgrace does this expression imply, since what was not a matter of wonder with the Jews has come to be so in the case of the Christians. If there was danger then in omitting tithes, think how great it must be now. And other fathers essentially say that giving percent was for the old covenant, but because the new covenant is superior, we give even more. Let's be clear, it's not about a percentage. It's about a mentality. If your mentality acts as though God's presence in the material world is either false or doesn't matter, then your offering will reflect that. But if your mentality is in alignment with Orthodox Christian theology of the incarnation, then your offerings will reflect that. It is true that not all of us can afford to offer 10%. Some of us live on the financial edge. I get that, and I've been there, but most of us can't afford it. And it's not really about what we can afford, but rather about what we will offer to God, knowing that he is present within us and within it. 10% is not a law anymore, it is true. But that does not mean that we do less. Indeed, as much as we are able, we do more. So I challenge you. I challenge you to believe in the incarnation of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. I challenge you to believe that His incarnation affects all the material world. I challenge you to put that belief into practice by keeping and venerating icons. I challenge you to put it into practice by receiving the Holy Mysteries, especially the Eucharist. And I challenge you to put it into practice by offering to God what is already His, in which He is already present, in a manner that is truly worthy of us, His creation-blessing royal priesthood. And I challenge you to tie. Will you join me and my friends? Let us make this holy offering together. To our Lord Jesus Christ who creates all things and is present in all things, be all glory, honor, and worship with his Father and the Holy Spirit now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen. especially here in North America, are pretty bad about giving our financial resources to Christ through our churches. There's just something about it. You know, certainly we could simply say that we're being stingy, that we're being selfish. We could also point to certain historical contingencies. The fact that many of our churches find their origins in places where the church was paid for by the state, established churches that were being supported directly by the government. And so people got out of the habit of giving. And there are certainly many, many times that we could point to in church history where we see that giving, and especially tithing, giving that 10%, gets kind of muted or abolished. And these times are plentiful enough, along with the immediate recent memory of a very meager way of supporting the church, that a lot of people feel justified by saying that it's not appropriate to ask Orthodox Christians to give in any really vigorous way to their churches. But all of that is based in a kind of mentality that is very problematic spiritually speaking. If we are Christians, if we seek to be like Christ, if we really love our God, then we're going to turn over all of our lives, everything that we have to the service of the Lord. We should not be asking what's the minimum, right? Or even what's the maximum. but rather, how do I dedicate what I have to the service of the Lord? And when we think about it in those terms, then that changes the way that we function in terms of money. And you might say to yourself, oh, well, you know, I have all these bills, I have to take care of my kids or whatever, whatever. I get that. You have to take care of those things. That's totally understandable. But the reason you take care of those things is because you're serving the Lord. You're serving the Lord. That is the project. That is the reason why you're taking care of your children and paying the bills that you owe and so forth. That's the reason. And when that's the reason, then you're not gonna say to yourself, well, what's the least I can give, you know, and be a member in good standing at my parish. That mentality becomes nonsense when you understand that all that you have is in order to serve the Lord. So when you ponder, what it means to be truly Christian. When you ponder the fact that we are the royal priesthood and so everything we touch becomes sanctified by our prayers, becomes sanctified by our presence because of the presence of Christ in us, then it makes sense to look at our financial resources and to give them over to God. It makes total sense, right? We have to get out of this mindset that is so grasping, so unwilling, so tight, so restricted, right? We have to get out of that mindset and move into a mindset of true generosity, which is based on the belief and the action based on that belief that what we have is given to us so that we can serve the Lord. And as I mentioned in the sermon, violence to our core theology of the Incarnation if we act like our physical resources, our material resources, are irrelevant or only sort of, you know, just a little part of our spiritual life, right? You know, it's like saying, well, you know, I'll make the sign of the cross, but I'm not going to make any prostrations because that's just too much. You know, or I'll pray at home, but I'm not going to come to church, you know, because that's just too much. No, no, no. We believe the incarnation of Christ. And so that means that matter is sanctified by virtue of God becoming man. And matter therefore being sanctified and we being joined to Christ, it means that the matter that is us and the matter that is the stuff that we possess is also sanctified. And if it's sanctified, it's the Lord's. It's the Lord's. So the question is, how do I serve the Lord with what I've been given? Speaking from a personal point of view, I have functioned many times Sometimes in my life, sometimes for long periods, with this kind of restricted mentality. You know, oh well, I know I'm supposed to give, but really? That much? 10%? Are you kidding? But when I made the decision to tithe, to give 10%, and it was a decision that I made together with my wife, when we made that decision, not only did we find that God took care of all of our needs. But we found that our hearts changed. Our hearts changed as a result of the action. Don't wait to feel generous before you begin to be generous. Be generous and then watch what happens to your heart. The action comes first and then the heart will follow it. So take that step of faith. Give as is really appropriate for an Orthodox Christian. Christian to give. You know, the Holy Fathers tell us that because we're in the New Covenant, we now should be doing more than in the Old Covenant. And if the Old Covenant had a tithe, then that means we should even be doing more. We should even be doing more. 10% is maybe too little. So may God give you courage and enable you to take that step and watch. Watch how He blesses you. I'm not talking materially. He might bless you materially, I don't know. But watch how your heart changes. Watch how you are unshackled. You're released from bondage to selfishness. It's really a beautiful thing and so worth doing. God bless you as you give because He first gave to you. Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America serving in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. I'm a husband and a dad and the author of multiple books. This has been a listener-supported presentation of Ancient Faith Radio.","groundTruth":"You're listening to Roads From Emmaus. I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick. This podcast, which is produced in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, features sermons and other talks about the exploration and engagement of Christian faith with the world. Jesus Christ both journeyed with his disciples on the road the biblical Emmaus and broke bread with them, thus revealing himself as both our fellow traveler and the incarnate word of God. Here's what we've got for today. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, one God. Amen. One of the acquisitions that certain Non-Orthodox Christians level against the Orthodox is that we worship idols. They say that when we bow before an icon or kiss it, or sense it, or light candles before it, we are worshiping that icon and giving to it what is due to God alone. Idolatry is one of the most ancient of sins. Giving worship to the creation rather than the, to the creator. It is condemned in The Holy Scriptures many times, being the most visceral kind of apostasy, a betrayal and abandonment of the one true God, giving devotion instead to something else. If it is true that the Orthodox are idolaters, then that means that we are not even Christians. You cannot worship both God and something else. You have to choose. On the Sunday of October that falls either on the 11th or immediately after, we make commemoration of the 7th Ecumenical Council, which meet in the year 787, in the city of Nicaea, to answer exactly this accusation of idolatry. I won't give you the full details of the arguments made, but I will summarize. The accusers, who are called iconoclast, a word that means icon smashers, made the argument that because God is invisible, you cannot depict him, except symbolically. So, to point to an icon and say, There is a picture of God, and especially then to venerate it is idolatry. The Fathers of the council, that is the Orthodox, instead declared that because God had become incarnate, that is because the son of God became man, he is now visible in Jesus Christ. And, because he is visible, then that means we not only may depict him, but we must depict him. Not to depict him is to deny the incarnation. Not to depict his Saints is to deny that Christ is in them, too, and thus, all veneration given to an icon of Christ or to the Saints is actually given to the one depicted and not to the material object itself. When you kiss the hand on an icon of Christ, you are kissing Christ. The incarnation is a central doctrine for Chris- for Christians. We must believe in it, if we are Christians. We cannot deny that God became man and be Christians, and we cannot deny the place that material, physical reality has for us and be Christians. What we do with our bodies and with the material world is directly dependent on what we believe about who Jesus Christ is. Because the one true God took on matter for himself by giving himself a human body, then that means that all creation becomes the vehicle for the divine presence. And, it means that, especially where we see that divinity manifest, we give honor. We worship God alone, but we honor and venerate those people and things in which he as sewn his presence. So, this has many practical applications for us. We spoke already about icons. Iconography is central to who we are as Orthodox Christians because it witnesses to the incarnation and helps to connect us to it. But, this truth about God's presence in materiality is not only about icons. We can also see how he is present in the Holy Mysteries, especially the Eucharist, which is his body and blood. But, this truth about God's presence in materiality is not only about what we call the sacraments. One of our problems as Christians living in the 21st Century is that we have tried to push God into one place or another and leave him there. We can visit him, but that is where he remains. For those who do not make and venerate icons, their God basically has no presence in the material world. He may be felt or perceived in some sense, but he is not here or there in particular. He may be everywhere, but he is not present in this icon or in this Saint. But, we as Orthodox Christians are guilty of this, too, although not in the same way. We are happy to welcome God into our temples, onto our altars, into our icons, et cetera, but when it comes to other elements of materiality, we expect him not to be present. Instead, we exile him. I could mention a number of ways in which we are exiling God. Such as, when we do not fast, exiling him from our bodies, or when we do not make our homes sanctified with prayer, exiling him from our families. But, I will mention, now, probably the worse problem that we have in this regard, when we do not generously return to him what is already his own, we exile him from our finances. Money can be an uncomfortable topic, but that is why we need to discuss it. For many, it's a festering wound that we want to put a band aid on but not cure. So, it's uncomfortable, but let's heal it. Given what we have said about God's presence in all the material reality, especially in certain people and places, we must also acknowledge that he is present in our possessions, and that includes our most tightly held possession, our money. And, this presence is especially strong in those things that belong to the people of God. Why? It is because our very presence as baptized and anointed members of the royal priesthood brings the blessing and presence of God wherever we are. Your possessions become holy because you are the ones possessing them. Because you belong to God and bring with you the presence of God, then he is more present in the things you own. The Earth is the Lord's and the fullness there of, but he is especially manifest in us, his Church. So, it is clear that God is present in our possessions. God is present in our money. So, knowing that God is present in what we have and knowing, also, that our task is to offer up the material world to God to as for his blessing, then that means that we have to get serious about offering our money. Let's be frank. Although, it certainly in the case that there are among us those who are indeed serious about offering up their money to God, most of us aren't. No one will judge you but God, but you can also judge yourself. Are you actually serious about offering to God what is his? Is what you're giving a true sacrifice, or are you giving merely a donation? Are you paying dues? Do you think that what you give to God is somehow contributing toward being eligible for a membership? Consider your income. Consider what you offer back to God. You, yourself know whether what you are sacrificing is appropriate to being a member of the royal priesthood. God is present in this material world, and he is present in us, the royal priesthood, and he is present in what we touch and what we possess and maintain because we bring his presence with us. As Orthodox Christians, we do not believe in a theology in which God is separate from the material world, and which, therefore, suggests that our possessions really are ours to do what we please. What is in your home is sacred. What you wear on your body is sacred. What is in your checking account is sacred. It is sacred because we have been declared by him to be sacred, and this sacredness is transmitted wherever we go because of our common priesthood. It is for this reason that in the Holy Scriptures God called upon his chosen people to tithe, to give 10% of their income to him. This was the called upon sacrifice that was proper to the royal priesthood of God. This was the appropriate way for them to show that they understood the sacred presence of God in their possessions by offering them back to him for his blessing. I know that some people deny that tithing is appropriate for Christians, but we have to ask why. Do they deny it because they have a true theological argument for it? Do they deny it because they found a place in the New Testament in which the Lord or the Apostles set that aside? I would welcome hearing such arguments. Alas, I suspect that those who deny this do so because they simply do not believe deep within their souls that God is present in this material world. So, that means that the material things that they own are really theirs and not Gods. I will not say that it is merely because they are greedy or envious. Only God knows that. It is true that The Holy Fathers of the Church actually did change the teaching on tithing that was received from the Old Covenant. That should not surprise us as there are many things which were change in the transition to the New Covenant. Here is what Saint Irenaeus says in the 2nd century; The Jews had, indeed, the tithes of their goods consecrated to him, but those who have received liberty, that is Christians, set aside all their possessions for the Lord's purposes. And here, Saint John Chrysostom speaking about someone who complains about tithing; What a load of disgrace does this expression imply? Since what was not a matter of wonder with Jews has come to be so in the case of the Christians. If there is danger then in omitting tithes, think our great it must be now. And other Fathers essentially say that giving 10% was for the Old Covenant, but because the New Covenant is superior, we give even more. Let's be clear. It's not about a percentage. It's about a mentality. If your mentality acts as though God's presence… presence in the material world is either false or doesn't matter, then your offering will reflect that. But, if your mentality is in alignment with Orthodox Christian theology if the incarnation, then your offerings will reflect that. It is true that not all of us can afford to offer 10%. Some of us live on the financial edge. I get that, and I've been there. But, most of us can afford it. And, it's not really about what we can afford, but rather about what we will offer to God. Knowing that he is present within us and within it. 10% is not a law anymore. It is true, but that does not mean that we do less. Indeed, as much as we are able, we do more. So, I challenge you. I challenge you to believe in the incarnation of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. I challenge you to believe that his incarnation effects all the material world. I challenge you to put that into… belief into practice by keeping and venerating icons. I challenge you to put it into practice by receiving the Holy Mysteries, especially the Eucharist. And, I challenge you to put it into practice by offering to God what is already his, in which he is already present in a manner that is truly worthy of us, his creation-blessing royal priesthood. And, I challenge you to tithe. Will you join me and my family? Let us make this Holy offering together. To our Lord Jesus Christ who creates all things and his present in all things, be all glory, honor, and worship with his Father and The Holy Spirit now and ever and onto ages of ages. Amen.

I'm Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at The New Yorker. On this episode of The Writer's Voice, we'll hear Tommy Orange read his story, The State, from the March 26, 2018 issue of the magazine. A graduate of the MFA program at the Institute of American Indian Arts, Orange will publish his first novel, There, There, from which this story was adapted, in June. Now here's Tommy Orange. You were two halves of a million different possibilities, a billion heads or tails, flip shine on spun coin. Before you were born, you were the idea to make it to California for gold or bust. You were white, you were brown, you were red, you were dust. You were hiding, you were seeking. Before you were born, you were chased, beaten, broken, trapped in Oklahoma. Before you were born, you were an idea your mom got into her head in the 70s to hitchhike across the country and become a dancer in New York. You were on your way when she did not make it across the country but sputtered and spiraled and landed in Taos, New Mexico at a peyote commune called Morning Star. Before you were born, you were your dad's decision to move away from Oklahoma to northern New Mexico to learn about a Pueblo blow guy's fireplace. You were the light in the wet of your parents' eyes as they met across that fireplace in ceremony. Before you were born, your halves inside them moved to Oakland. Before you were born, before your body was much more than heart, spine, bone, skin, blood, and vein, when you'd just started to build muscle, before you showed, bulged in her belly, as her belly, Before your dad's pride could belly swell at the sight of you, your parents were in a room listening to the sound your heart made. You had an arrhythmic heartbeat. The doctor said it was normal. Your arrhythmic heart was not abnormal. Maybe he's a drummer, your dad said. He doesn't even know what a drum is, your mom said. And the man said arrhythmic. That means no rhythm. Maybe it just means he knows the rhythm so good he doesn't always hit it when you expect him to. Rhythm of what? She said. But once you got big enough to make your mom feel you, she couldn't deny it. You swam to the beat. When your dad brought out the kettledrum, you'd kicked her in time with it. Or in time with her heartbeat. Or with one of the oldies mix tapes she'd made from records she loved and played endlessly in your AeroStar minivan. You were out in the world, running and jumping and climbing. You tapped your toes and fingers everywhere, all the time. On tabletops, desktops. You tapped every surface you found in front of you. Listened for the sound things made back at you when you hit them. The timbre of taps, the din of dings. Silverware clangs in kitchens, door knocks, knuckle cracks, head scratches. You were finding out that everything made a sound. Everything could be drumming, whether the rhythm was kept or strayed, even gunshots and backfire, the howl of trains at night, the wind against your windows. The world was made of sound. But inside every kind of sound lurked a sadness, in the quiet between your parents after a fight they'd both managed to lose, or when you and your sisters listened through the walls for early signs of a fight about to start. for the late signs of a fight reignited. The sound of the church service, the building wail of worship, your mom speaking in tongues on the crest of that weekly Sunday wave. Sadness because you couldn't feel any of it, though you wanted to. You felt that you needed it, that it could protect you from the dreams you had almost every night about the end of the world and the possibility of hell forever. You living there, still a boy, unable to leave or die or do anything but burn in a lake of fire. Sadness came in the sound of your dad snoring in church, even as members of the congregation, members of your family, were being slain by the Holy Ghost in the aisle right next to him. Sadness came in the quiet of the street when the days got shorter at the end of summer and the kids weren't out anymore. In the color of that fleeting sky, sadness lurked. Sadness pounced, slid into everything it could find its way into. through anything, through sound, through you. You didn't think of any of the tapping or the knocking as drumming until you actually started drumming many years later. It would have been good to know that you'd always done something naturally, but there was too much going on with everyone else in your family for anyone to notice that you should probably have done something else with your fingers and toes than tap, with your mind and time than knock at all the surfaces in your life like you were looking for a way in. You're headed to a powwow. You were invited to drum at the big Oakland powwow, even though you quit drum group. You weren't going to go. You haven't wanted to see anyone from work since you got fired, especially anyone from the powwow committee. But there's never been anything like it for you, the way that big drum fills your body until there's only the drum, the sound, the song. The name of your drum group is Southern Moon. You joined a year after you started working at the Indian Center as a janitor. You're supposed to say a custodian now, or maintenance person, but you've always thought of yourself as a janitor. When you were 16, you went on a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit your uncle, your mom's brother. He took you to the Smithsonian American Art Museum, where you discovered James Hampton. He was an artist, a Christian, a mystic, like a janitor. James Hampton ended up meaning everything to you. Anyway, being a janitor was just a job. It paid the rent. And you could have your earphones in all day. No one wants to talk to the guy cleaning up. The earphones are an additional service. People don't have to pretend to be interested in you because they feel bad that you're taking their trash out from under their desk and giving them a fresh bag. Tuesday nights. All were welcome. Not women, though. They had their own drum group. Thursday nights. They were Northern Moon. You first heard the big drum by accident one night after work. You'd come back because you'd forgotten your earphones. You were just about to get on the bus when you realized they weren't in your ears when you most wanted them for that long ride home. The drum group played on the first floor. You walked into the room room, and just as you did, they started singing high-voiced wailing and howled harmonies that screamed through the boom of that big drum. Old songs that sang to the old sadness he always kept as close as skin without meaning to. The word triumph flashed in your head then. What was it doing there? You never used that word. But that was what it sounded like to make it through these hundreds of American years, to sing through them. That was the sound of pain forgetting itself in song. You went back every Tuesday for the next year. Keeping time wasn't hard for you. The hard part was singing. You'd never been a talker. You'd certainly never sung before. Not even alone. But Bobby made you do it. Bobby was big. Maybe 6'4\", 350. He said that it was because he came from eight different tribes. He had to fit all of them in there, he said, pointing at his belly. He had the best voice in the group, hands down. He could go high or low. And he was the one who invited you in. If it were up to Bobby, the drum group would be bigger, would include everyone. He'd have the whole world on a drum if he could. Bobby Vic Medicine. Sometimes the name fit just right. Your voice is low like your dad's. You can't even hear it when I sing, you told Bobby after group one day. So what? Adds body. Bass harmony is underappreciated, Bobby told you. Then handed you a cup of coffee. The big drum's all you need for bass, he said. Voice bass is different than drum bass, Bobby said. Drum bass is closed. Voice bass opens. I don't know, he said. Voice can take a long time to come all the way out, brother, Bobby said. Be patient. You walk outside your studio apartment to a hot Oakland summer day. An Oakland you remember as gray, always gray. Oakland summer days from your childhood. Mornings so gray they filled the whole day with gloom and cool, even after the blue broke through. This heats too much. You sweat easily. Sweat from walking. Sweat at the thought of sweating. Sweat through clothes to where it shows. You take off your hat and squint up at the sun. the sun. At this point you should probably accept the reality of global warming. The ozone thinning again, like they said it was in the 90s, when your sisters used to balm their hair with aquanet and you'd gag and spit in the sink extra loud to let them know you hated it and to remind them about the ozone, how hairspray was the reason the world might burn like it said in Revelation. The next end, the second end after the flood, a flood of fire from the sky this time, Maybe from the lack of ozone protection. Maybe because of their abusive aquanet. And why did they need their hair three inches in the air, curled over like a breaking wave? Because what? You never knew. Except that all the other girls did it too. And haven't you also heard or read that the world tilts on its axis ever so slightly every year so that the angle makes the earth like a piece of metal when the sun hits it just right and it becomes just as bright as the sun itself? Haven't you heard that it's getting hotter because of this tilt, this ever-increasing tilt of the earth, which was inevitable and not humanity's fault, not our cars or our emissions or aquanet, but plain and simple entropy? Or was it atrophy? Or was it apathy? You're near downtown, headed for the 19th Street BART station. You walk with a slightly dropped, sunken right shoulder, just like your dad, the limp, too, right side. You know that this limp could be mistaken for some kind of affect, some lame attempt at gangsta lean. But on some level that you maybe don't even acknowledge, you know that walking like you do subverts the straight-postured, upright, citizenly way of moving one's arms and feet just so, to express obedience, to pledge allegiance to a way of life and to a nation and its laws. Left, right, left, and so on. But have you really cultivated this drop-shouldered walk, this lean, the right and opposition? Is it really some Native-specific countercultural thing you're going for? Some vaguely anti-American movement? Or do you walk the way your dad walked simply because genes and pain and styles of walking and talking get passed down without anyone even trying? The limp is something you've cultivated to look more like a statement of your individual style and less like an old basketball injury. To get injured and not recover is a sign of weakness. Your limp is practiced. An articulate limp, which says something about the way you've learned to roll with the punches. All the times you've been fucked over, knocked down. What you've recovered from or haven't. What you've walked or limped away from. With or without style. That's on you. You pass a coffee shop you hate because it's always hot and flies constantly swarm the front of the shop. Where a big patch of sunlight seeds with some invisible shit the flies love and where there's always just that one one seat left in the heat with the flies, which is why you hate it, on top of the fact that the place doesn't open until ten in the morning and closes at six in the evening. To cater to all the hipsters and artists who hover and buzz around Oakland like flies themselves. America's white suburban vanilla youth, searching for some invisible thing Oakland can give them. Street cred or inner city inspiration. Before getting to the 19th Street Station, you pass a group of white teenagers whose size you up. You're almost afraid of them. Not because you think they'll do anything. It's how out of place they are, all the while looking like they own the city. You want to run them down. Scream something at them. Scare them back to wherever they came from. Scare them out of Oakland. Scare the Oakland they've made their own out of them. You could do it, too. You're one of these big, lumbering Indians. Six feet, 230, on your shoulder, so heavy it makes you lean, makes everyone see you, your weight, what you carry. Your dad is 1,000% Indian, an overachiever, a recovering alcoholic medicine man from Oklahoma for whom English is his second language. He loves to gamble and smokes American spirit cigarettes. He has false teeth and prays for 20 minutes before every meal, asks for help from the creator for everyone. beginning with the orphaned children and ending with the servicemen and servicewomen out there. Your 1000% Indian dad, who cries only in ceremony and has bad knees, which took a turn for the worse when you were 10 and he laid concrete in your backyard for a basketball court. You know your dad could once play ball, knew the rhythm of the bounce, the head fake and eye swivel, pivot shit you learned how to do by putting in time. Sure, he leaned heavily on shots off the glass but that was the way it used to be done. Your dad told you he hadn't been allowed to play ball in college because he was Indian in Oklahoma. Back in 1963, that was all it took. No Indians or dogs allowed on the courts or in bars. Your dad hardly ever talked about any of that, being Indian in Oklahoma, or even what he felt like now that he was a certifiable urban Indian. Except sometimes, when it suited him. out of nowhere. to that. He'd push his big Indian lips out to embarrass you, stick one flat hand out and stab at the air and rhythm to the beat just to mess with you. That was when you'd turn the music off altogether. And that was when you might hear a story from your dad about his childhood, about how he used to pick cotton with his grandparents for a dime a day, or the time an owl threw rocks at him and his friends from a tree, or the time his great-grandma split a tornado in two with a prayer. The chip you carry has to do with being born and raised in Oakland. A concrete chip. A slab, really. Heavy on one side, the half side, the not-white side. As for your mom's side, as for your whiteness, there's too much and not enough there to know what to do with. You're from a people who took and took and took and took. And from a people taken. You're both and neither. In the bath, you'd stare at your brown arms against your white legs in the water and wonder what they were doing together on the same body, in the same bathtub. How you ended up getting fired was related to your drinking, which was related to your skin problems, which was related to your father, which was related to history. The one story you were sure to hear from your dad, the one thing you knew for certain about what it means to be Indian, was that your people, Cheyenne people, on November 29, 1864, were massacred at Sand Creek. He told you and your sisters that story more than any other story he could muster. Your dad was the kind of drunk who disappears weekends, lands himself in jail. He was the kind of drunk who had to stop completely, who couldn't have a drop. So you had it coming, in a way. That need that won't quit. That year's deep pit you were bound to dig, crawl into, struggle to get out of. Your parents maybe burned a two-wide god hole through you. The hole was unfillable. Coming out of your 20s, you started to drink every night. There were many reasons for this, but you did it without a thought. Most addictions aren't premeditated. You slept better. Drinking felt good. But mostly, if there was any real reason you could pinpoint, it was because of your skin. You'd always had skin problems. Your dad used to rub peyote gravy on your ashes. That worked for a while, until he wasn't around anymore. The doctors wanted to call it eczema. They wanted you hooked on steroid creams. The scratching was bad because it only led to more scratching, which led to more bleeding. You'd wake up with blood under your fingernails, a sharp sting wherever the wound moved. It moved everywhere, all over your body, and blood ended up on your sheets. And you'd wake up feeling like you'd dreamed something as important and devastating as it was forgotten. But there was no dream. There was only the open, living wound, and it itched somewhere in your body at all times. Patches and circles and fields of red and pink, sometimes yellow, bumpy, pussy, weeping, disgusting. the surface of you. If you drank enough, you didn't scratch at night. You could deaden your body that way. You found your way in and out of a bottle, found your limits, lost track of them. Along the way, you figured out that there was a certain amount of alcohol you could drink that could, the next day, produce a certain state of mind, which you over time began to refer to privately as the state. The state was a place you could get to where everything felt exactly, precisely in place, where and when it belonged, you belonged, completely okay in it, almost like your dad used to say, in it, like, isn't that right? Isn't that true? But each bottle you bought was a medicine or a poison, depending on whether you managed to keep it full enough. The method was unstable, unsustainable. To drink enough but not too much for a drunk was like asking an evangelical not to say the name Jesus. And so playing drums and singing in those classes had given you something else, a way to get there without having to drink and wait and see if the next day the state might emerge from the ashes. The state was based on something you read about James Hampton years after your trip to D.C. James had given himself a title. director of special projects for the state of eternity. James was a Christian. You are not. But he was just crazy enough to make sense to you. This is what made sense. He spent 14 years building an enormous piece of artwork out of junk he collected in and around the garage he rented, which was about a mile from the White House. The piece was called The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nation's Millennium General Assembly. James made the throne for Jesus' second coming. What you get about James Hampton is his almost desperate devotion to God, to waiting for his God to come. He made a golden throne from junk. The throne you were building was made of moments, made of experiences in the state after excess drinking, made of leftover, unused drunkenness, kept overnight, dreamed, moon-soaked fumes you breathed into throne form. into a place where you could sit. In the state, you were just unhinged enough to not get in the way. The problem came from having to drink at all. The night before you got fired, drum class was canceled. It was the end of December, the approach of the new year. This kind of drinking was not about reaching the state. This kind of drinking was careless, pointless. One of the risks, the consequences of being the kind of drunk you were and will always be no matter how well you learn to manage it. By night's end you'd finished a fifth of a Jim Beam. A fifth is a lot if you don't work your way up to it. It can take years to drink this way, alone, on random Tuesday nights. It takes a lot from you, drinking this way, your liver, the organ doing the most living for you, detoxifying all the shit you put into your body. When you got to work the next day, you were fine. a little dizzy, still drunk, but the day felt normal enough. You went into the conference room. The Pow Wow committee meeting was happening. You ate what they called breakfast enchiladas when they offered them. You met a new member of the committee, and your supervisor, Jim, called you into his office, called on the two-way you kept on your belt. When you got to his office, he was on the phone. He covered it with one hand. he said, and pointed out to the hallway, get it out. We can't have bats. This is a medical facility. He said it like you'd brought the bat in yourself. Out in the hallway, you looked up and around you. You saw the thing on the ceiling in the corner near the conference room at the end of the hall. You went and got a trash bag and a broom. You approached the bat carefully, slowly, but when you got close, it flew into the conference room. Everyone, the whole pack, howl committee, head spinning, watched as you went in there and chased it out. In the hallway, the bat circled around you. It was behind you, and then it was on the back of your neck. It had its teeth or claws dug in. You freaked out and reached back and got the bat by a wing, and instead of doing what you should have done, put it in the trash bag you were carrying with you. You brought your hands together, and with all your strength, everything you had in you, you squeezed You crushed the bat in your hands, blood and thin bones and teeth in a mess in your hands. You threw it down. You would mop it up quick, wipe clean the whole day, start over again. But no, the whole powwow committee was there. They'd come out to watch you catch the bat after you'd chased the thing into their meeting. They looked at you with disgust. You felt it too. It was on your hands, on the floor, that creature. Back in your supervisor's office after you'd cleaned up the mess, Jim gestured for you to sit down. I don't know what that was, he said. Both hands were on top of his head. But it's not something we can tolerate in a medical facility. The thing fucking, sorry, but the thing fucking bit me. I was reacting. And that would have been okay, Thomas. Only co-workers saw. And I was told you smell like alcohol. Coming to work drunk. I'm sorry, but that's a fireball offense. You know we have a zero tolerance policy here. He didn't look mad anymore. He looked disappointed. You almost told him that it was from the night before, but maybe that wouldn't have made a difference. Because the alcohol was still in you. In your blood. I did not drink this morning, you said. He almost crossed your heart. He'd never even done that when you were a kid. It was something about Jim. He was like a big kid. He didn't want to have to punish you. Crossing your heart seemed like a reasonable way to convince Jim that you were telling the truth. The robot voice announces the next stop by saying or not saying exactly, but whatever it's called when robots speak. The next station is 12th Street, Oakland City Center. to a Berkeley high school gym where your old family friend, Paul, danced over the basketball lines with that crazy light step, that grace, even though Paul was pretty big, and you never thought of him as graceful before. But that day you saw what a powwow was and you saw that Paul was perfectly capable of grace and even some kind of Indian-specific cool with footwork not unlike breakdancing and the effortlessness that cool requires. The train moves and you think of your dad and how he took you to that powwow after the divorce. How he had never taken you before, when you were younger. And you wonder if it was your mom and her Christianity, the reason you didn't go to powwows or do more Indian things. The train emerges, rises out of the underground tube in the Fruitvale District, over by that Burger King and the terrible pho place where East 12th and International almost merge. graffiti department walls and abandoned houses, warehouses, and auto body shops appear, loom in the train window, stubbornly resist all of Oakland's new development. Just before the Fruitvale station, you see the old brick church you always notice because of how run down and abandoned it looks. You feel a rush of sadness for your mom and her failed attempt to make you believe, for your failed family. different states now. How you never see them. How you spend so much time alone. You want to cry and you feel as if you might, but know that you can't, that you shouldn't. Crying ruins you. You gave it up long ago, but the thoughts keep coming. About your mom and your family at a certain time when the magical over and underworld of your Oakland-spun Christian evangelical end-of-the-world spirituality seemed to come to life to take you, all of you. You remember it so clearly, that time, before anyone was awake, your mom was crying into her prayer book. You knew this because you saw the tear stains in her prayer book. You looked into that book more than once because you wanted to know what questions she might have asked God, what private conversations she might have had with Him, she who spoke that mad angel language of tongues and church, she who fell to her knees She who fell in love with your dad in Indian ceremonies that she later called demonic. Your train leaves the Fruitvale station, which makes you think of Diamond Park, which makes you think of Vista Street. That was where it all happened, where your family lived and died. Your older sister, Delana, was heavily into PCP, angel dust. That was when you found out that you don't need religion to be saved. for the demons to come out with their tongues. One day after school, Delana smoked too much PCP. She came home and it was clear to you that she was out of her mind. You could see it in her eyes. Delana's eyes without Delana behind them. And then there was her voice, that low, deep, guttural sound. She yelled at your dad and he yelled back and she told him to shut up and he did shut up because of that voice. She told him to shut up that he didn't even know which god he was worshiping. And soon after that, Delana was on the floor of your sister Christine's room, foaming at the mouth. Your mom called an emergency prayer circle, friends from church, and they prayed over her, and she foamed and writhed and eventually stopped when that part of the eye wore off. The drug dimmed, her eyes closed. The thing was done with her. When she woke up, your mom gave her a glass of milk. And when she was back, with her normal voice and her normal eyes, she didn't remember any of it. Later, your mom said that taking drugs was like sneaking under the gates into the kingdom of heaven. It seemed to you more like the kingdom of hell, but maybe the kingdom of heaven is bigger and more terrifying than we can ever know. Maybe we've all been speaking the broken tongue of angels and demons for too long to know that that's what we are. who we are, what we're speaking. Maybe we don't die, but change, always in this state, without ever even knowing that we're in it. When you get off at the Coliseum Station, you walk over the pedestrian bridge with butterflies in your stomach. You do and don't want to be there. You want to drum, but also be heard drumming, not as yourself, but as the drum, the big drum sound that makes the dancers dance. You don't want to be seen by anyone from work. The shame of your drinking and showing up to work with the smell still on you is too much. Getting attacked by the bat and crushing it in front of them is part of it, too. You go through the metal detector at the front, and your belt gets you another go-through. You get the beep the second time because of change in your pocket. The security guard is an older black guy who doesn't seem to care much about anything but avoiding the beep. the beeping of the detector. Take it out. Anything. Anything in your pockets. Take it out, he says. That's all I got, you say. But when you walk through it beeps again. You ever have surgery, the guy asks you. What? I don't know, maybe you have a metal plate in your head or... Nah, man, I got nothing metal on me. Well, I gotta pat you down now, the guy says, like it's your fault. All right, you say and put your arms up. He looks you down, he gestures for you to walk through again. This time when it beeps, he just waves you on. About 10 feet away, you're looking down as you walk, and you realize what it was. Your boots. Steel toe. You started wearing them when you got the job. Jim recommended it. You almost go back to tell the guy, but it doesn't matter anymore. You find Bobby Big Medicine under a canopy. He nods up, then tilts his head toward an open seat. feet around the drum. There's no small talk. Grand entry song, Bobby says to you, because he knows everyone else knows. You pick up your drumstick and wait for the others. You hear the sound but not the words that the powwow emcee is saying, and you watch for Bobby's stick to go up. When it does, it feels as though your heart stops. You wait for the first hit. You pray a prayer in your head to no one in particular about nothing in particular. You clear away for a prayer by thinking nothing. Your prayer will be the hit and the song and the keeping of time. Your prayer will begin and end with the song. Your heart starts to hurt from lack of breath when you see his drumstick go up and you know they're coming. The dancers. And it's time.

Thanks for listening.","groundTruth":"This is The Writer's Voice, new fiction from The New Yorker. I'm Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at The New Yorker. On this episode of The Writer's Voice, we'll hear Tommy Orange read his story, The State, from the March 26 2018 issue of the magazine. A graduate of the MFA program at the Institute of American Indian Arts, Orange will publish his first novel, There There, from which this story was adapted in June. Now, here's Tommy Orange. The State. Before you were born, you were a head and a tail in a milky pool. A swimmer. You were a race, a dying off, a breaking through, an arrival. Before you were born, you were an egg in your mom, who was an egg in her mom. Before you were born, you were a nested Russian doll of possibility in your mom's ovaries. You were two halves of a million different possibilities, a billion heads or tails, flip-shine on spun coin. Before you were born, you were the idea to make it to California for gold or bust. You were white, you were brown, you were red, you were dust. You were hiding, you were seeking. Before you were born, you were chased, beaten, broken, trapped in Oklahoma. Before you were born, you were an idea your mom got into her head in the '70s, to hitchhike across the country and become a dancer in New York. You were on your way when she did not make it across the country but sputtered and spiraled and landed in Taos, New Mexico, at a peyote commune called Morning Star. Before you were born, you were your dad's decision to move away from Oklahoma, to northern New Mexico to learn about a Pueblo guy's fireplace. You were the light in the wet of your parents' eyes as they met across that fireplace in ceremony. Before you were born, your halves inside them moved to Oakland. Before you were born, before your body was much more than heart, spine, bone, skin, blood, and vein, when you'd just started to build muscle, before you showed, bulged in her belly, as her belly, before your dad's pride could belly-swell at the sight of you, your parents were in a room listening to the sound your heart made. You had an arrhythmic heartbeat. The doctor said it was normal. Your arrhythmic heart was not abnormal. Maybe he's a drummer, your dad said. He doesn't even know what a drum is, your mom said. And the man said arrhythmic. That means no rhythm. Maybe it just means he knows the rhythm so good he doesn't always hit it when you expect him to. Rhythm of what? she said. But, once you got big enough to make your mom feel you, she couldn't deny it. You swam to the beat. When your dad brought out the kettledrum, you'd kick her in time with it, or in time with her heartbeat, or with one of the oldies mixtapes she'd made from records she loved and played endlessly in your Aerostar minivan. Once you were out in the world, running and jumping and climbing, you tapped your toes and fingers everywhere, all the time. On tabletops, desktops. You tapped every surface you found in front of you, listened for the sound things made back at you when you hit them. The timbre of taps, the din of dings, silverware clangs in kitchens, door knocks, knuckle cracks, head scratches. You were finding out that everything made a sound. Everything could be drumming, whether the rhythm was kept or it strayed. Even gunshots and backfire, the howl of trains at night, the wind against your windows. The world was made of sound. But inside every kind of sound lurked a sadness. In the quiet between your parents after a fight they'd both managed to lose. Or when you and your sisters listened through the walls for the early signs of a fight about to start. For the late signs of a fight reignited. The sound of the church service, the building wail of worship, your mom speaking in tongues on the crest of that weekly Sunday wave. Sadness because you couldn't feel any of it, though you wanted to. You felt that you needed it, that it could protect you from the dreams you had almost every night about the end of the world and the possibility of hell forever. You living there, still a boy, unable to leave or die or do anything but burn in a lake of fire. Sadness came in the sound of your dad snoring in church, even as members of the congregation, members of your family, were being slain by the Holy Ghost in the aisle right next to him. Sadness came in the quiet of the street when the days got shorter at the end of summer and the kids weren't out anymore. In the color of that fleeting sky, sadness lurked. Sadness pounced, slid into everything it could find its way into, through anything, through sound, through you. You didn't think of any of the tapping or the knocking as drumming until you actually started drumming, many years later. It would have been good to know that you'd always done something naturally. But there was too much going on with everyone else in your family for anyone to notice that you should probably have done something else with your fingers and toes than tap, with your mind and time than knock at all the surfaces in your life like you were looking for a way in. You're headed to a powwow. You were invited to drum at the Big Oakland Powwow even though you quit drum group. You weren't gonna go. You haven't wanted to see anyone from work since you got fired. Especially anyone from the powwow committee. But there's never been anything like it for you, the way that big drum fills your body until there's only the drum, the sound, the song. The name of your drum group is Southern Moon. You joined a year after you started working at the Indian Center as a janitor. You're supposed to say custodian now, or maintenance person, but you've always thought of yourself as a janitor. When you were 16, you went on a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit your uncle, your mom's brother. He took you to the Smithsonian American Art Museum, where you discovered James Hampton. He was an artist, a Christian, a mystic, a janitor. James Hampton ended up meaning everything to you. Anyway, being a janitor was just a job. It paid the rent, and you could have your earphones in all day. No one wants to talk to the guy cleaning up. The earphones are an additional service. People don't have to pretend to be interested in you because they feel bad that you're taking their trash out from under their desk and giving them a fresh bag. Drum group was Tuesday nights. All were welcome. Not women, though. They had their own drum group, Thursday nights. They were Northern Moon. You first heard the big drum by accident one night after work. You'd come back because you'd forgotten your earphones. You were just about to get on the bus when you realized they weren't in your ears when you most wanted them, for that long ride home. The drum group played on the first floor. You walked into the room and, just as you did, they started singing. High-voiced wailing and howled harmonies that screamed through the boom of that big drum. Old songs that sang to the old sadness you always kept as close as skin, without meaning to. The word triumph flashed in your head then. What was it doing there? You never used that word. But that was what it sounded like to make it through these hundreds of American years, to sing through them. That was the sound of pain forgetting itself in song. You went back every Tuesday for the next year. Keeping time wasn't hard for you. The hard part was singing. You'd never been a talker. You'd certainly never sung before. Not even alone. But Bobby made you do it. Bobby was big, maybe six-four, three-50. He said that it was because he came from eight different tribes. He had to fit all of them in there, he said, pointing at his belly. He had the best voice in the group, hands down. He could go high or low. And he was the one who invited you in. If it were up to Bobby, the drum group would be bigger, would include everyone. He'd have the whole world on a drum if he could. Bobby Big Medicine, sometimes a name fit just right. Your voice is low, like your dad's. You can't even hear it when I sing, you told Bobby after group one day. So what? Adds body. Bass harmony is underappreciated, Bobby told you, then handed you a cup of coffee. The big drum's all you need for bass, you said. Voice bass is different from drum bass, Bobby said. Drum bass is closed. Voice bass opens. I don't know, you said. Voice can take a long time to come all the way out, brother, Bobby said. Be patient. You walk outside your studio apartment to a hot Oakland summer day, an Oakland you remember as gray, always gray. Oakland summer days from your childhood. Mornings so gray they filled the whole day with gloom and cool, even after the blue broke through. This heat's too much. You sweat easily. Sweat from walking. Sweat at the thought of sweating. Sweat through clothes to where it shows. You take off your hat and squint up at the sun. At this point, you should probably accept the reality of global warming. The ozone thinning again, like they said it was in the '90s, when your sisters used to bomb their hair with Aqua Net and you'd gag and spit in the sink extra loud to let them know you hated it and to remind them about the ozone, how hair spray was the reason the world might burn like it said in Revelation, the next end, the second end after the flood, a flood of fire from the sky this time, maybe from the lack of ozone protection, maybe because of their abuse of Aqua Net. And why did they need their hair three inches in the air, curled over like a breaking wave? Because what? You never knew. Except that all the other girls did it, too. And haven't you also heard or read that the world tilts on its axis ever so slightly every year so that the angle makes the earth like a piece of metal when the sun hits it just right and it becomes just as bright as the sun itself? Haven't you heard that it's getting hotter because of this tilt, this ever-increasing tilt of the earth, which was inevitable and not humanity's fault, not our cars or our emissions or Aqua Net but plain and simple entropy. Or was it atrophy, or was it apathy? You're near downtown, headed for the 19th Street BART station. You walk with a slightly dropped, sunken right shoulder. Just like your dad. The limp, too, right side. You know that this limp could be mistaken for some kind of affect, some lame attempt at gangsta lean, but on some level that you maybe don't even acknowledge you know that walking like you do subverts the straight-postured upright citizenly way of moving one's arms and feet just so, to express obedience, to pledge allegiance to a way of life and to a nation and its laws. Left, right, left, and so on. But have you really cultivated this drop-shouldered walk, this lean to the right, in opposition? Is it really some Native-specific countercultural thing you're going for? Some vaguely anti-American movement? Or do you walk the way your dad walked simply because genes and pain and styles of walking and talking get passed down without anyone even trying? The limp is something you've cultivated to look more like a statement of your individual style and less like an old basketball injury. To get injured and not recover is a sign of weakness. Your limp is practiced. An articulate limp, which says something about the way you've learned to roll with the punches, all the times you've been fucked over, knocked down, what you've recovered from or haven't, what you've walked or limped away from, with or without style. That's on you. You pass a coffee shop you hate because it's always hot and flies constantly swarm the front of the shop, where a big patch of sunlight seethes with some invisible shit the flies love and where there's always just that one seat left, in the heat with the flies, which is why you hate it, on top of the fact that the place doesn't open until 10 in the morning and closes at six in the evening, to cater to all the hipsters and artists who hover and buzz around Oakland like flies themselves, America's white suburban vanilla youth, searching for some invisible thing Oakland can give them, street cred or inner-city inspiration. Before getting to the 19th Street station, you pass a group of white teenagers who size you up. You're almost afraid of them. Not because you think they'll do anything. It's how out of place they are, all the while looking like they own the city. You want to run them down. Scream something at them. Scare them back to wherever they came from. Scare them out of Oakland. Scare the Oakland they've made their own out of them. You could do it, too. You're one of these big, lumbering Indians. Six feet, two-30, chip on your shoulder so heavy it makes you lean, makes everyone see you, your weight, what you carry. Your dad is 1,000% Indian. An overachiever. A recovering alcoholic medicine man from Oklahoma, for whom English is his second language. He loves to gamble and smokes American Spirit cigarettes. He has false teeth and prays for 20 minutes before every meal, asks for help from the Creator for everyone, beginning with the orphan children and ending with the servicemen and servicewomen out there, your 1,000% Indian dad, who cries only in ceremony and has bad knees, which took a turn for the worse when you were 10 and he laid concrete in your back yard for a basketball court. You know your dad could once play ball, knew the rhythm of the bounce, the head fake and eye swivel, pivot shit you learned how to do by putting in time. Sure, he leaned heavily on shots off the glass, but that was the way it used to be done. Your dad told you he hadn't been allowed to play ball in college because he was Indian in Oklahoma. Back in 1963, that was all it took. No Indians or dogs allowed on the courts or in bars. Your dad hardly ever talked about any of that, being Indian in Oklahoma, or even what he felt like now that he was a certifiable urban Indian. Except sometimes. When it suited him. Out of nowhere. You'd be riding in your dad's red Ford truck to Blockbuster to rent a movie. You'd be listening to his peyote tapes. The tape, staticky gourd rattle and kettledrum boom. He liked to play it loud. You couldn't stand how noticeable the sound was. How noticeably Indian your dad was. You'd ask if you could turn it off. You'd put on 106 KMEL, rap or R&B. But then he'd try to dance to that. He'd push his big Indian lips out to embarrass you, stick one flat hand out and stab at the air in rhythm to the beat, just to mess with you. That was when you'd turn the music off altogether. And that was when you might hear a story from your dad about his childhood. About how he used to pick cotton with his grandparents for a dime a day or the time an owl threw rocks at him and his friends from a tree or the time his great-grandma split a tornado in two with a prayer. The chip you carry has to do with being born and raised in Oakland. A concrete chip, a slab, really, heavy on one side, the half side, the not-white side. As for your mom's side, as for your whiteness, there's too much and not enough there to know what to do with. You're from a people who took and took and took and took. And from a people taken. You're both and neither. In the bath, you'd stare at your brown arms against your white legs in the water and wonder what they were doing together on the same body, in the same bathtub. How you ended up getting fired was related to your drinking, which was related to your skin problems, which was related to your father, which was related to history. The one story you were sure to hear from your dad, the one thing you knew for certain about what it means to be Indian, was that your people, Cheyenne people, on November 29, 1864, were massacred at Sand Creek. He told you and your sisters that story more than any other story he could muster. Your dad was the kind of drunk who disappears weekends, lands himself in jail. He was the kind of drunk who had to stop completely. Who couldn't have a drop. So you had it coming, in a way. That need that won't quit. That years-deep pit you were bound to dig, crawl into, struggle to get out of. Your parents maybe burned a too-wide God hole through you. The hole was unfillable. Coming out of your 20s you started to drink every night. There were many reasons for this. But you did it without a thought. Most addictions aren't premeditated. You slept better. Drinking felt good. But mostly, if there was any real reason you could pinpoint, it was because of your skin. You'd always had skin problems. Your dad used to rub peyote gravy on your rashes. That worked for a while. Until he wasn't around anymore. The doctors wanted to call it eczema. They wanted you hooked on steroid creams. The scratching was bad because it only led to more scratching, which led to more bleeding. You'd wake up with blood under your fingernails, a sharp sting wherever the wound moved, because it moved everywhere, all over your body, and blood ended up on your sheets, and you'd wake up feeling like you'd dreamed something as important and devastating as it was forgotten. But there was no dream. There was only the open, living wound, and it itched somewhere on your body at all times. Patches and circles and fields of red and pink, sometimes yellow, bumpy, pus-y, weeping, disgusting, the surface of you. If you drank enough, you didn't scratch at night. You could deaden your body that way. You found your way in and out of a bottle. Found your limits. Lost track of them. Along the way, you figured out that there was a certain amount of alcohol you could drink that could, the next day, produce a certain state of mind, which you over time began to refer to privately as the State. The State was a place you could get to where everything felt exactly, precisely in place, where and when it belonged, you belonged, completely okay in it. Almost like your dad used to say, In'it, like, Isn't that right? Isn't that true? But each bottle you bought was a medicine or a poison, depending on whether you managed to keep it full enough. The method was unstable. Unsustainable. To drink enough but not too much for a drunk was like asking an evangelical not to say the name Jesus. And so playing drums and singing in those classes had given you something else. A way to get there without having to drink and wait and see if the next day the State might emerge from the ashes. The State was based on something you read about James Hampton, years after your trip to D.C. James had given himself a title: Director of Special Projects for the State of Eternity. James was a Christian. You are not. But he was just crazy enough to make sense to you. This is what made sense: he spent 14 years building an enormous piece of art work out of junk he collected in and around the garage he rented, which was about a mile from the White House. The piece was called The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly. James made the throne for Jesus' second coming. What you get about James Hampton is his almost desperate devotion to God. To waiting for his God to come. He made a golden throne from junk. The throne you were building was made of moments, made of experiences in the State after excess drinking, made of leftover, unused drunkenness, kept overnight, dreamed, moon-soaked fumes you breathed into throne form, into a place where you could sit. In the State, you were just unhinged enough to not get in the way. The problem came from having to drink at all. The night before you got fired, drum class was canceled. It was the end of December. The approach of the New Year. This kind of drinking was not about reaching the State. This kind of drinking was careless, pointless, one of the risks, the consequences of being the kind of drunk you were. And will always be, no matter how well you learn to manage it. By night's end, you'd finished a fifth of Jim Beam. A fifth is a lot if you don't work your way up to it. It can take years to drink this way, alone, on random Tuesday nights. It takes a lot from you. Drinking this way. Your liver. The organ doing the most living for you, detoxifying all the shit you put into your body. When you got to work the next day, you were fine. A little dizzy, still drunk, but the day felt normal enough. You went into the conference room. The powwow-committee meeting was happening. You ate what they called breakfast enchiladas when they offered them. You met a new member of the committee. Then your supervisor, Jim, called you into his office, called on the two-way you kept on your belt. When you got to his office, he was on the phone. He covered it with one hand. There's a bat, he said and pointed out to the hallway. Get it out. We can't have bats. This is a medical facility. He said it like you'd brought the bat in yourself. Out in the hallway, you looked up and around you. You saw the thing on the ceiling in the corner near the conference room at the end of the hall. You went and got a trash bag and a broom. You approached the bat carefully, slowly, but when you got close it flew into the conference room. Everyone, the whole powwow committee, heads spinning, watched as you went in there and chased it out. In the hallway, the bat circled around you. It was behind you, and then it was on the back of your neck. It had its teeth or claws dug in. You freaked out and reached back and got the bat by a wing and instead of doing what you should have done, put it in the trash bag you were carrying with you, you brought your hands together and with all your strength, everything you had in you, you squeezed. You crushed the bat in your hands. Blood and thin bones and teeth in a mess in your hands. You threw it down. You would mop it up quick. Wipe clean the whole day. Start over again. But no. The whole powwow committee was there. They'd come out to watch you catch the bat after you'd chased the thing into their meeting. They looked at you with disgust. You felt it, too. It was on your hands. On the floor. That creature. Back in your supervisor's office after you'd cleaned up the mess, Jim gestured for you to sit down. I don't know what that was, he said. Both hands were on top of his head. But it's not something we can tolerate in a medical facility. The thing fucking… Sorry, but the thing fucking bit me. I was reacting. And that would have been okay, Thomas. Only co-workers saw. And I was told you smell like alcohol. Coming to work drunk, I'm sorry, but that's a fireable offense. You know we have a zero-tolerance policy here. He didn't look mad anymore. He looked disappointed. You almost told him that it was from the night before, but maybe that wouldn't have made a difference, because the alcohol was still in you, in your blood. I did not drink this morning, you said. You almost crossed your heart. You'd never even done that when you were a kid. It was something about Jim. He was like a big kid. He didn't want to have to punish you. Crossing your heart seemed like a reasonable way to convince Jim that you were telling the truth. I'm sorry, Jim said. So that's it? I'm being fired? There's nothing I can do for you, Jim said. He stood up and walked out of his own office. Go home, Thomas, he said. You get down to the train platform and appreciate the cool wind or breeze or whatever you call the rush of air the train brings before it arrives, before you even see it or its lights, because of how much it cools your sweaty head. You find a seat at the front of the train. The robot voice announces the next stop, by saying or not saying, exactly, but whatever it's called when robots speak, The next station is 12th Street Oakland City Center. You remember your first powwow. Your dad took you and your sisters, after the divorce, to a Berkeley high-school gym, where your old family friend Paul danced over the basketball lines with that crazy-light step, that grace, even though Paul was pretty big, and you'd never thought of him as graceful before. But that day you saw what a powwow was and you saw that Paul was perfectly capable of grace and even some kind of Indian-specific cool, with footwork not unlike break dancing, and the effortlessness that cool requires. The train moves and you think of your dad and how he took you to that powwow after the divorce, how he had never taken you before, when you were younger, and you wonder if it was your mom and her Christianity, the reason you didn't go to powwows or do more Indian things. The train emerges, rises out of the underground tube in the Fruitvale district, over by that Burger King and the terrible pho place, where East 12th and International almost merge, where the graffitied apartment walls and abandoned houses, warehouses, and auto-body shops appear, loom in the train window, stubbornly resist all of Oakland's new development. Just before the Fruitvale station, you see the old brick church you always notice because of how run-down and abandoned it looks. You feel a rush of sadness for your mom and her failed attempt to make you believe, for your failed family. How everyone lives in different states now. How you never see them. How you spend so much time alone. You want to cry and you feel as if you might, but know that you can't, that you shouldn't. Crying ruins you. You gave it up long ago. But the thoughts keep coming, about your mom and your family at a certain time when the magical over and underworld of your Oakland-spun Christian evangelical end-of-the-world spirituality seemed to come to life to take you, all of you. You remember it so clearly, that time. Before anyone was awake, your mom was crying into her prayer book. You knew this because you saw the tearstains in her prayer book. You looked into that book more than once because you wanted to know what questions she might have asked God, what private conversations she might have had with Him, she who spoke that mad-angel language of tongues in church, she who fell to her knees, she who fell in love with your dad in Indian ceremonies that she later called demonic. Your train leaves the Fruitvale station, which makes you think of Dimond Park, which makes you think of Vista Street. That was where it all happened, where your family lived and died. Your older sister, DeLonna, was heavily into PCP, angel dust. That was when you found out that you don't need religion to be slain, for the demons to come out with their tongues. One day after school, DeLonna smoked too much PCP. She came home and it was clear to you that she was out of her mind. You could see it in her eyes, DeLonna's eyes without DeLonna behind them. And then there was her voice, that low, deep, guttural sound. She yelled at your dad and he yelled back and she told him to shut up and he did shut up because of that voice. She told him that he didn't even know which God he was worshiping, and soon after that DeLonna was on the floor of your sister Christine's room, foaming at the mouth. Your mom called an emergency prayer circle, friends from church, and they prayed over her and she foamed and writhed and eventually stopped when that part of the high wore off, the drug dimmed, her eyes closed, the thing was done with her. When she woke up, your mom gave her a glass of milk, and when she was back, with her normal voice and her normal eyes, she didn't remember any of it. Later, your mom said that taking drugs was like sneaking under the gates into the Kingdom of Heaven. It seemed to you more like the Kingdom of Hell, but maybe the Kingdom of Heaven is bigger and more terrifying than we can ever know. Maybe we've all been speaking the broken tongue of angels and demons for too long to know that that's what we are, who we are, what we're speaking. Maybe we don't die but change, always in the State, without ever even knowing that we're in it. When you get off at the Coliseum station, you walk over the pedestrian bridge with butterflies in your stomach. You do and don't want to be there. You want to drum but also to be heard drumming. Not as yourself but as the drum. The big drum sound that makes the dancers dance. You don't want to be seen by anyone from work. The shame of your drinking and showing up to work with the smell still on you is too much. Getting attacked by the bat and crushing it in front of them is part of it, too. You go through the metal detector at the front and your belt gets you another go-through. You get the beep the second time because of change in your pocket. The security guard is an older black guy who doesn't seem to care much about anything but avoiding the beeping of the detector. Take it out, anything, anything in your pockets, take it out, he says. That's all I got, you say. But when you walk through it beeps again. You ever have surgery? the guy asks you. What? I don't know, maybe you have a metal plate in your head or— Nah, man, I got nothing metal on me. Well, I gotta pat you down now, the guy says, like it's your fault. All right, you say and put your arms up. After he pats you down, he gestures for you to walk through again. This time when it beeps he just waves you on. About 10 feet away, you're looking down as you walk and you realize what it was. Your boots. Steel toe. You started wearing them when you got the job. Jim recommended it. You almost go back to tell the guy, but it doesn't matter anymore. You find Bobby Big Medicine under a canopy. He nods up then tilts his head toward an open seat around the drum. There's no small talk. Grand Entry song, Bobby says to you, because he knows everyone else knows. You pick up your drumstick and wait for the others. You hear the sound but not the words that the powwow m.c. is saying, and you watch for Bobby's stick to go up. When it does, it feels as though your heart stops. You wait for the first hit. You pray a prayer in your head to no one in particular about nothing in particular. You clear a way for a prayer by thinking nothing. Your prayer will be the hit and the song and the keeping of time. Your prayer will begin and end with the song. Your heart starts to hurt from lack of breath when you see his drumstick go up and you know they're coming, the dancers, and it's time.

"},{"id":"RobertGupta_2010U","dataset":"tedlium-3","hypothesis":" One day Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music and the source was a man an African-American man charming rugged homeless playing a violin that only had two strings I'm telling a story that many of you know because Steve's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later, he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental, if you'll pardon the pun, in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's first and fourth symphonies and came backstage and introduced himself when speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first vinyl in passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's 4th Symphony. And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment, because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result, now he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had a kind of manic glint in his eyes. He was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was poisoning him. in his sleep. And I was afraid. Not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him. That he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. So I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction for which my playing, the music, was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, acquired curiosity, and grace. And in a miracle, he lived. lifted his own violin and he started playing by ear certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius and we started talking about music from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's from Bartok all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen and I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant Juilliard-trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality and That is an escape from his tormented state And I understood that this was the very essence of art This is the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions and Through our artistic lens through our creativity. We're able to shape those emotions into reality And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists, so please forgive me.","groundTruth":"one day los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los

of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts. And instead of thinking about information overload, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. Pivot and with pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter on one particular cause of death say accidents and right away I see there's a different pattern that emerges This is because in the mid area here people are their most active and over here. They're their most frail We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death seeing that circulatory diseases and cancers are the usual suspects But not for everyone if we go ahead and we filter by age say 40 years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. So you get the idea that viewing information, viewing data in this way is a lot like swimming and then living information infographic. And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. It's all here. It's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk With pivot you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue So I'm looking at this. I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the sports I'm a Lance Armstrong fan So I'll go ahead and I'll click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of Now if I want to just kind of take a peek at these I might think, well, what about taking a look at all of cycling so I can step back and expand on that? And I see Greg Lamont now. And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way, going narrow, broader, backing in, backing out, you're not searching, you're not browsing, you're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between. And we think it changes the way information can be used. So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. What we've done here is we've taken every single single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things. Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular in Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now, having selected government, I can now see that the Wikipedia Categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine people of the year So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular summaries I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them So looking at these people I can see that the majority come from government Some have come from natural sciences. Some, fewer still, have come from business. There's my boss. And one has come from music. And interestingly enough, Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go jump and take a look at all TED Prize winners. So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time. time as if it's actually a web. Not from page to page, but at a higher level of abstraction. And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So pivot this application. I don't want to call it a browser. It's really not a browser. But you can view web pages with it. And we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. So I can step back, pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way, I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. Here in fact is the state of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And if I want to step back and look at everything, I can slice and dice my history, perhaps by my search history. Here I was doing some nepotistic searching, looking for being over here for LiveLabs Pivot. And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times. And in each case, it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down so that instead of now navigating from one thing to the next, we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden. If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. And instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge, there may be these when there's wisdom to be found.

the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not page to page but at a higher level of abstraction and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise i'm just showing the new york times website here so pivot this application i don't want to call it a browser it's really not a browser but you can view web pages with it and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this so i can step back pop right back in to a specific section now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today and if i want to step back and look at everything i can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history here i was doing some nepotistic searching looking for bing over here for live labs pivot and from these i can drill into the web page and just launch them again it's one metaphor repurposed multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data so right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of information overload we talk about drowning in data what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden if we can do that then instead of being trapped in data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and if we get the knowledge then maybe even there's wisdom to be found so with that i thank you"},{"id":"TomWujec_2010U","dataset":"tedlium-3","hypothesis":" Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the Marshmallow Challenge. And the idea is pretty simple. Teams of four have to build the tallest freestanding structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string, and a marshmallow. The marshmallow has to be on top. And though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. And so I thought this was an interesting idea. and I incorporated it into a design workshop and it was a huge success. And since then I've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects, even the CTOs of the Fortune 50. And there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and I'd like to share some of them with you. So normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power, then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch in, they lay out spaghetti, they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures, and then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back and ta-da! They admire their work. But what really happens most of the time is that the ta-da turns into an and uh-oh, because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. So there are a number of people who have a lot more uh-oh moments than others. And among the worst are recent graduates of business school. They lie, they cheat, they get distracted, and they produce really lame structures. And of course, there's teams that have a lot more ta-da structures. And among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. It's pretty amazing as Peter tells us not only do they produce the tallest structures, but the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is how come? Why? What is it about them? And Peter likes to say that none of the none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti Inc. Right. They don't spend time jockeying for power. But there's another reason as well. And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan. Right. And then they execute on it. And then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on top, they run out of time. And what happens? It's a crisis. Sound familiar, right? Okay. What kindergartners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes, successive prototypes, always keeping the marshmallow on top. So they have multiple times to fix and they build prototypes along the way. So designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. And with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play and prototype is really essential. But let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for most people is around 20 inches. Business school students, about half of that. Lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that. Kindergartens, better than most adults. Who does the very best? Architects and engineers, thankfully. 39 inches is the tallest structure I've seen. And why is it? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self-reinforced stable structures. So, CEOs, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting. If you put in an executive admin on the team, they get significantly better. Incredible. You know, you look around, you go, oh, that team's going to win. You can just tell beforehand. And why is that? Because they have special skills of facilitation. They manage the process, they understand the process and any team who manages and pays the close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills, the combination leads to strong success. If you have 10 teams that typically perform, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. And I tried something interesting. I thought, let's up the ante once. So I offered a $10,000 prize of software to the winning team. So what do you think happened to these design students. What was the result? Here's what happened. Not one team had a standing structure. Not one had, if anyone had built, say, a one-inch structure, they would have taken home the prize. So isn't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact? We did the exercise again with the same students. What do you think happened then? So now they understand the value of prototyping. So the same team went from being the very worst worst to being among the very best. They produce the tallest structures in the least amount of time. So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. So you might ask, why would anyone actually spend time running a marshmallow challenge? And the reason is I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. Because frankly, Every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? as well. And the fundamental lesson I believe is that design truly is a contact sport. It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh-oh moment to a ta-da moment and that can make a big difference.

business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults who does the very best architects and engineers thankfully and thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i i've seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self re enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self reinforce stable

digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly every project has its own marshmallow doesn't it the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge dot com it's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows there's step by step instructions on this there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system there's world records on this as well and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a
